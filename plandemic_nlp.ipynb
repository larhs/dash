helpful please like it subscribe to my channel well this is dr . raun day today 's question asks if i can discuss the case of xxmaj sarah xxmaj marie xxmaj johnson she was an dividual who was convicted of a double parasite which is an extremely rare type of murder so she was a real person so it 's important i dicate here that i 'm not diagnosg her but rather just speculatg on what could have been gog on a situation like this so first i 'm gog to go through the timele this case then look at some of the mental health personality human behavior aspects after that i 'm gog to take a look briefly at the concept of juvenile parasite aga a rare type of crime fairly terestg so this case starts really three people so other people were volved but it mostly volves three people xxmaj sarah xxmaj marie xxmaj johnson who at the time 2003 was 16 years old her father an xxmaj johnson who 's 6 years old xxmaj diane xxmaj johnson who is 52 years old they lived ellevue xxmaj xxunk they had been married for 20 years so we see the case really starts early on xxmaj september 2nd 2003 we see that xxmaj sarah xxmaj johnson runs out of her home screamg for help she runs over to a neighbor 's house she says that her parents have just been murdered when the police arrived they found xxmaj diane xxmaj johnson xxmaj sarah xxmaj johnson 's mother lyg under the covers her bed she was deceased most of her head was missg they also found an xxmaj johnson lyg next to the bed apparently dead from a gunshot wound to the chest it appears that an stepped out of the shower because he was still wet so he stepped out of the shower he was shot then managed to walk to the bedroom where he collapsed now a trash can outside the xxmaj johnson 's home the police recovered a pk xxunk two gloves a righthed xxunk glove a lefthed leather glove now side the house they also found a great deal of evidence cludg biological material blood xxunk tissue bone fragments that went from the xxmaj johnson 's bedroom to the hallway across to xxmaj sarah xxmaj johnson 's bedroom so xxmaj sarah xxmaj johnson 's bedroom was across from her parents bedroom they also recovered a weapon at the scene a 26 xxunk magnum rifle which is a rifle that has quite a bit of recoil this place apart later on the trial this was found the master bedroom the police also recovered two butcher knives the tips of these knives were touchg they were placed at the end of the xxmaj johnsons bed there was no evidence of forced entry to the house but the house was never locked anyway so that really did n't contribute much to the vestigation when xxmaj sarah first talked to the police she gave several different stories five different accounts actually now one of the key s consistencies here was that she said that her room was closed her bedroom door was closed but they found biological evidence that it was not meang they found xxup dna blood splatter bone tissue her room from the homicide so it turns out her door must have been opened now this is just one consistency but several were discovered her story she admitted that the pk robe belonged to her but she denied knowg how it ended up the trash can when the police first asked about the rug the way xxmaj sarah responded was that she did not kill her parents the police found this to be kd of an terestg way to approach that question so they found it odd now this is an terestg piece here because i fd that police often do this these type of cases they look at the human behavior side they say well it does n't really fit based on what was gog on so her behavior may have been odd but if her parents were just murdered she was n't the perpetrator then it 's hard to know how somebody should react people react to stress a lot of different ways but of course this was used agast her the trial later on now the rifle i mentioned just a moment ago that was used to kill the xxmaj johnsons belonged to somebody that they rented a garage apartment to his name was xxmaj mel xxmaj xxunk he had an alibi he was away from that area durg the time of the murders he did dicate how that it was his rifle he kept it unlocked his apartment xxmaj sarah xxmaj johnson had access to that apartment when the police terviewed the friends neighbors they tend to thk that xxmaj sarah xxmaj johnson was fatuated a 1 year old boyfriend named runo xxmaj santos so runo xxmaj santos became kd of key suspect early on these two had been datg for about three months before the murder of the xxmaj johnsons they did not approve of him for a variety of reasons on xxmaj august 2th which was just a few days before the murders xxmaj sara told her parents she 'd be spendg a night friends but stead she spent the night runo xxmaj santos when her parents found out her father went to look for the next day confronted xxmaj santos brought her home she was grounded from that pot on now later on accordg to a witness testimony we found out that xxmaj sarah seemed to take this punishment pretty well unusually well usually she 'd be upset when somethg like this happened she did n't seem to be upset so later on when the police had an opportunity to analyze the evidence there was xxup dna testg other testg done that connected a robe to xxmaj sara xxmaj johnson the gloves to xxmaj sara xxmaj johnson later on they would also fd a shower cap that had been xxunk down the toilet after this xxmaj sara xxmaj johnson was charged firstdegree murder durg her trial there was a lot of testimony about xxmaj sarah xxmaj johnson 's appropriate behavior how she tended to not have emotions that people thought fit the situation she seemed to be more concerned her boyfriend she also did n't appear to be traumatized at her parents funeral she talked about how she wanted to play xxunk that night some other people also said that her sadness seemed to be superficial i thk this is important because there 's a few aspects here that a mental health professional might be able to detect but a member of the general public might not be able to but yet of course it 's still admissible court for example if she did not seem traumatized well what does somebody who 's traumatized seem like what does that look like also what is superficial sadness how did we defe that how would we know when somebody 's beg sad but it 's only really at the surface so aga kd of how people appear after events like this this is used agast them even if the person evaluatg that behavior is not really qualified to comment on the nuances that behavior they 're not really qualified to assess the person so i thk of course as i 'll talk about later on i thk she was guilty of these crimes but it 's terestg how these pieces kd of come together people look at somebody they say oh they do n't seem to be traumatized or they seemed to have superficial feelgs aga that 's used testimony a similar way we see that her brother testified agast her described her as dramatic a good actress somebody who lied a lot so there 's a lot of people testifyg agast xxmaj sarah xxmaj johnson based on her behavior so now terms of the defense i 've talked about what the prosecution had to say terms of the defense they noted that there was a lack of blood or tissue found on xxmaj sarah or her clothg they did n't fd anythg her hair or her hs or really anywhere now the mother xxmaj diane was shot at close range so really it would be impossible that the murderer would n't have been xxunk blood so this became kd of a key part of the case for the defense there were no fgerprts found on the xxunk on the rifle or those knives that were arranged i talked about but there was testimony from one of xxmaj sarah xxmaj johnson 's cellmates usually i thk of this type of testimony as extremely unreliable it was admitted probably did n't help her case of course she was found guilty on two counts of murder the first degree she was sentenced to two life terms she will not have the possibility of parole at this pot she 's out of xxmaj appeals there were several appeals that took place she was unsuccessful so that 's the timele this case this is an extremely terestg case xxmaj sarah xxmaj johnson really almost got away these murders but they were poorly planned for example there was a garbage truck that would have picked up the trash where that evidence was there was one house away when the police arrived so she almost did get away this parasite now we see that terms of some of the case characteristics or terestg runo xxmaj santos seemed like somebody the police should really vestigate it was a confrontation between him the dad a few days before i mentioned that the police found him to be arrogant he had a weak alibi he had been the house before he refused to stop seeg xxmaj sara xxmaj johnson even though the parents told him to stop so he aga seemed like a good cidate to consider for this murder but when they vestigated him they found no evidence that he was volved so then the case kd of turned toward xxmaj sara xxmaj johnson there was quite a bit of evidence that tied her to these murders now i 've already talked about the physical evidence that was the robe the gloves that are connected to her there was some bruisg on her shoulder from the recoil of the rifle she tried to expla it away but it was lear the way it was on her shoulder it did look like it came from the rifle but terms of behavioral evidence this became kd of a key part her case it makes her case kd of terestg her consistencies terms of when she was terviewed by the police itially none of this looked good this did n't go her favor so terms of the mental health personality human behavior perspective aga just speculatg on what could have been gog on a situation like this we see that this type of case where you have a young female perpetrator committg a double parasite is exceedgly rare parasites are rare already when a male commits them a female committg a parasite particularly a juvenile female this is somethg we just do n't see the mental health professionals at testify at trial i 'll get to their testimony a mute they said that she did have clical depression a suicide attempt but no history of violence were crime so aga double parasite just does n't seem to fit this case now i mentioned the parasites are exceedgly rare about two to four percent of all homicides xxmaj western countries are parasites about two percent of homicides the xxmaj united xxmaj states are parasites nety percent of the perpetrators are male when somebody kills both their father their mother a situation like that it 's almost always a male so a parasite all female is very rare especially a double parasite if we look at about the last 25 years or so there are fewer than five cases like this the xxmaj united xxmaj states that i could fd all of them volved abuse aga xxmaj sarah xxmaj johnson did n't appear to be abused so there 's been a lot of fascation terest this case because it 's unusual it may actually be really the only case of its type aga the last 25 years or maybe even more the xxmaj united xxmaj states so now takg a closer look at the mental health piece to mental health professionals testified durg the trial really at the sentencg phase they really were talkg about the hope that xxmaj sarah xxmaj johnson could be rehabilitated really they said similar thgs right so the first clician said that xxmaj sarah xxmaj johnson had clical depression for the two years xxunk the murders but showed no evidence of psychosis conduct disorder or antisocial personality evidence of conduct disorder before the age of 15 is required for a diagnosis of antisocial personality but aga no evidence was available that supported either of those diagnoses she did not appear to be prone to violence she was described as beg fairly normal now this clician said that she was amenable to rehabilitation thought it was very likely that if she was released some day she would never commit another crime like this now the next mental health professional testified really found the same thg except he appeared to have even a more positive image of the chances of rehabilitation he dicated she had a high potential for successful rehabilitation lookg at her mental health history her personality characteristics he concluded there would be a substantial likelihood that she could be reformed completely not pose any danger to society now terestgly what he really added to this discussion was that she did n't need to accept responsibility at this pot order to be rehabilitated so i guess he was kd of thkg that she was n't confessg to the crimes at that pot at sentencg but maybe she would lay then that could facilitate her rehabilitation later on so throughout this whole process to the trial even up till now as far as i know she 's never accepted responsibility for these crimes she still says that she 's not guilty so weighg this testimony the court concluded that rehabilitation her case was possible but there 's certa conduct that crosses a le somebody represents too much of a danger to society so she was aga sentenced to life prison out the possibility of parole we see her attempts to appeal that the ma argument was that sentencg a child to die prison constitutes cruel unusual punishment many states have banned this practice other states are very careful about life sentences for mors but either way the court stayed the origal fdg she 's prison for life so what happened the case of xxmaj sarah xxmaj johnson aga this is such an unusual case what motivated her to commit these crimes what caused this well she was careful her planng so of course it did appear premeditated but it also appeared to be driven by kd of an immature emotional reaction the whole boyfriend thg that she was tryg to move forward she wanted to see the boyfriend her parents would let her it 's hardly a reason to commit a heous murder now it sts to reason that impulsivity may have played a part these murders positive urgency this is n't somebody has positive emotions they ca n't resist the impulse to act on them also negative urgency because she did n't get along her parents so that could have contributed i thk there was xxup xxunk a degree of fantasy which is n't unusual people that are narcissistic so it may have been that she had some narcissistic tendencies i thk she had fantasies potentially about money the xxunk money as well as of course a life the boyfriend now it was brought up at trial that she watched a lot of true crime xxup tv that 's where maybe she got the idea of how to use the robe the gloves tried to make it look like she was n't guilty now that does n't necessarily speak to why she did it but it 's terestg that maybe she kd of learned some of those tactics from television now aga we 've never seen a confession this case so really kd of left out knowg what really happened we have little sight to our state of md we 're just left to speculate based on this restricted amount of evidence so the last part i 'll cover here is parasite i 'll talk about parasite some of its characteristics aga i mentioned this was a double parasite committed by a juvenile female extremely rare event we see the juvenile parasite is an extremely low base rate behavior to start most of the time when we see juvenile parasite it 's because of abuse or is connected to abuse some way meang a child was abused then they acted out so they feel trapped they feel like they ca n't get out of the situation they have no other way to go so they end up committg a murder about 25 percent of time they will use an xxunk much of the time juvenile parasite offenders have little or no histories terms of juvenile delquency or violent behavior we also see they 're not usually volved mental health treatment although some have had personality disorders juvenile xxunk offenders tend to kill xxunk situations so they killed a parent while the parents back is turned or while they 're sleepg or on a computer or somethg like that so this case we kd of see this does connect to what happened we see the xxmaj sara xxmaj johnson shot her mother her mother was asleep at the time then went toward the bathroom entered the bathroom shot her father so we do n't know if maybe she was tryg to kill both of them really quickly out anybody knowg out havg to have some sort of confrontation but when she walked the room i 'm sure she could hear that the showers runng so she must have known that she was gog to kill the mother then have to confront the father so that was kd of another unusual part of this case of course this case has a lot of unusual features this idea that she confronted the father he was stg up awake alert when he was shot now we solved the trial to his speculation that she must have xxunk the father some way there was this idea that there must have been some sort of short disguise that occurred if she said somethg to him or she heard somethg from him but we do n't really know she could have shot the mother operated a xxunk rifle then shot the father just that quickly so we do n't really know if any communication occurred aga she did n't reveal any formation about that now because of this element of this type of crime shootg somebody when they 're not lookg or they 're sleepg xxunk is a hard argument for juvenile xxunk offenders to make of course we see xxmaj sarah xxmaj johnson she goes through this elaborate process to make it look like somebody else committed the crime we also see parasites a lot of times a battered child syndrome is used as a defense but aga xxmaj sarah xxmaj johnson was n't abused so that could n't be used either so terms of as a mental health community what can we do about juvenile parasite parasite general double parasite unfortunately there is n't much we can do juvenile parasite particular is essentially impossible to predict as are a lot of parasites there is no way to predict somethg that has such a low base rate especially because there 's a little history of delquent behavior or violence so it 's tough to get front of these types of cases prevent them we just do n't know when they 're gon na happen or who 's gon na xxunk them on top of this there are no risk assessment xxunk that are currently available that can help us to predict juvenile parasite either so we really have no tools to work terms of preventg this type of crime obviously if somebody 's workg a client they say they 're gon na do this or there 's some clear evidence a counselor can act on that but outside of that we do n't really get a lot of warng these types of cases so this is a very terestg case as i mentioned this is really one of the most rare types of murders that we see really anywhere i do n't thk this case really received a lot of attention but it is pretty terestg i thk if xxmaj sarah xxmaj johnson had confessed told her story that would have attracted a little bit more attention because we could have really received more formation about maybe what she was thkg but she did n't so aga we 're kd of cut off we do n't have a lot of formation the case does n't really generate a lot of terest now so i know whenever i talk about these types of cases like xxunk committg parasite cases like this there 's gog to be different opions if you agree or disagree me or have other opions please put those the comments that always generates a really terestg dialogue as always i hope you found this description of the xxmaj sarah xxmaj johnson murder case to be terestg thanks for watchg,xxbos welcome to my scientifically formed sider look at mental health topics if you fd this video to be terestg or helpful please like it subscribe to my channel hello this is dr . gre today 's question asks i can analyze the mental health personality characteristics at work the xxmaj darlie routier case another question here is what do i thk terms of her guilt or nocence so the people this case of course are real people so just a remder i 'm not diagnosg anybody only speculatg about what could be happeng a situation like this so first i 'll take a look at the timele then the evidence the vestigation i 'll look at the trial as well the mental health personality characteristics answer that question about guilt nocence so we start the timele xxmaj thursday xxmaj june 6th 16 xxmaj xxunk xxmaj texas this is a town that 's 25 miles north of xxmaj dallas xxmaj texas we see it 's xxunk a.m. 26 yearold xxmaj darlie routier calls 11 reports that an truder broke to her house attacked her her two sons her husb xxmaj aaron 28 a third son ke who was 7 months old were asleep upstairs the house the police arrived just mutes later as they were xxunk the house they noticed that the wdows screen the garage had been cut they failed to fd any truder so they permitted the paramedics to enter xxmaj darlie son xxmaj devon aged 6 was found dead her son xxmaj damon aged 5 would die before reachg the hospital xxmaj darlie told the police that she decided to sleep downstairs so she could watch xxup tv she had been sleepg downstairs on off over the last several weeks because the baby 's crib was the master bedroom the baby will grow up when he moved she was asleep the family room xxmaj devon xxmaj damon when she felt a nudge on her shoulder heard xxmaj damon xxunk talkg she opened her eyes saw a stranger wearg dark clothg a baseball cap stg over her of course this is her report about what happened xxmaj darlie said she walked after the assailant heard glass breakg as he fled she got halfway through the kitchen then she went back to turn on a light as she ran back toward the utility room you saw a xxunk knife on the floor this is when she realized that she was covered blood xxmaj darlie reached down picked up the knife as the truder made his exit through a door the garage xxmaj darlie dropped the knife yelled upstairs to wake up xxmaj dar her husb this is when she xxunk 11 this call to 11 lasted five mutes seconds four mutes five seconds to the call xxmaj darlie dicated that there was a knife the operator said there 's a knife do n't touch anythg xxmaj darlie responded i already touched it picked it up five mutes four seconds to the call xxmaj darlie says the knife was lyg over there i already picked it up the operator says it 's all right xxmaj darlie responds by sayg i bet we could have gotten the prts may be referrg to prts on the knife the statement would be used agast her later on at trial at 3:0 a.m. xxmaj darlie went to surgery so by some accounts her wounds were severe specifically the wound on her neck was only two millimeters away from her xxunk artery the surgeons also had to remove part of a necklace that had been pushed to the wound on her neck other cuts were on her arms as well other accounts though say that all the wounds were superficial so we see disagreement about how severely she was wounded now movg to the vestigation the trial at 6:00 11:00 a.m. detectives from the xxmaj xxunk xxmaj police xxmaj department terviewed xxmaj darlie she could not offer a description of the xxunk face around the same time we see that a socalled crime scene consultant named xxmaj james cron arrived at darlie 's house he stated that 20 to 30 mutes after he arrived he had determed that there had been no truder this shaped the vestigation gog forward it really ruled out the possibility of fdg a suspect other than xxmaj darlie or xxmaj dar this remds me of a short story by xxmaj edgar len xxmaj poe named the murders the room work there 's this particular sentence from this story that i thk connects over what happened here so i 'll read the sense this idea however simple it may now seem escaped the police for the same reason that the breadth of the xxunk had escaped them because by the affair of the nails their perceptions had been hermetically sealed agast the possibility of the wdows have ever been opened at all of course we see there that poses wdows have ever stead of wdows havg ever but that was written a long time ago but either way that story we see that what xxunk really sayg is the possibility was ruled out by the police aga their mds hermetically sealed so nothg was gettg terrupt aga we see that here this case the vestigation really got off to a bad start it was extremely limited from the begng now movg to xxmaj june 18 we see that xxmaj darlie was arrested evidently the police were xxunk celebratg as she was arrested so kd of xxunk to see that reaction we see she was dicted by a gr jury on xxmaj june 28th now there was a change venue this trial because of the media coverage the trial opened on xxmaj january 6 17 so really the trial started pretty quickly considerg when the arrest was especially considerg this was a capital murder case the prosecutor presented his theory that xxmaj darlie was suicidal suffered from depression she must have killed her boys an effort to mata her xxunk lifestyle now we hear these stories about the prosecution tryg to make it seem like the motive was surance money but actually the prosecution did not contend that xxmaj darlie killed for that money we see the closg arguments the prosecution talked about motive not beg required that 's actually true motive was not required the jury could fd xxmaj darlie guilty out knowg a motive or out one beg demonstrated so what i fd terestg about the openg the prosecution here is how they 're kd of weaponizg mental health symptoms so as far as the prosecution is concerned depression just ca n't be somethg that 's common causes sufferg rather it must expla why people commit murder so a real leap there that is quite illogical it shows a real lack of understg of how depression works now terms of specifically the thoughts of suicide that 's a little different if somebody 's at a high risk to commit suicide they could be at a higher risk to harm other people right that 's not usual it happens but that could happen we see a lot of different testimony this trial a physician testified that darlie 's wounds could have been selfflicted police officers testified that xxmaj darlie seemed overly concerned her own wounds did not render aid to her sons which makes me kd of wonder what level of concern would be permitted if somebody is wounded if she had ignored her own wounds they might have labeled her a psychopath also we see that she had bruises on her arms but those appeared later so that kd of worked agast her now we see about that cut wdow that the police determed that the dust around the wdow was xxunk therefore they determed that it would be impossible for anybody to have entered or xxunk through that wdow later we see a demonstration that illustrated one could easily move out of that wdow out disturbg anythg we see a man 's white tube sock was located near a storm dra about 75 yards from the house the sock had blood on it from both xxmaj devon xxmaj damon the prosecution determed that xxmaj darlie must have planted it now this is terestg considerg the testimony we see this trial from the defense we see testimony that established xxmaj damon could not have lived more than ne mutes after his wounds were xxunk now takg to account the amount of time that xxmaj darlie spent on the phone the 11 operator aga about five mutes seconds this only leaves xxmaj darlie just over three mutes to plant the sock get back to the house commit the crimes staged the crime scene xxunk those wounds on herself the prosecution attempted to refute this by sayg that she could have planted the sock beforeh that the medical testimony around that amount of time that xxmaj damon would have lived was not precise now that 11 call of course xxmaj darlie express was concerned about fdg prts on the knife the prosecutor says here that she did this to set up her defense another possible conclusion of course is that she wanted the person who did it to be caught then we have the birthday party this is arguably the most controversial circumstance that was brought up at the trial the funeral for xxmaj devon xxmaj damon was on xxmaj sunday xxmaj june th xxmaj darlie was released from the hospital the day before we see on the xxmaj friday after as xxmaj june 1 the xxmaj xxunk would have turned seven so xxmaj darlie other family members a number of friends had a birthday party at the xxunk now this occurred after a private memorial service at this party there were xxunk toys durg this party we see xxmaj darlie smiled laughed sprayed silly strg now we see the closg arguments that one of the prosecutors kd of makes a big deal about the silly strg tape he says that this tape gives you a lot of sight to this woman durg their xxunk the jury xxunk this clip of the birthday party eight or ne times so clearly they were considerg the content of that video now the lead prosecutor this case was named xxmaj greg xxmaj davis when he saw this recordg this was long before the trial he said how disgusted he was that anybody could act that way now this is an terestg choice of words for him to reveal that he was feelg disgusted disgust is really an emotion of eradication disposal destruction right so if somebody 's disgusted by somethg they want to get rid of it it 's not the same thg as fear now it 's terestg because xxmaj greg xxmaj davis would later be dicted on a felony unrelated to this case xxunk a government record although he was never convicted now other testimony he spoke to perhaps a fancial motive xxmaj charlie 's housekeeper dicated that xxmaj darlie told her that she needed $ 10,000 so maybe there was some money problems gog on that couple fact i thk it was pretty well established that they were n't good shape fancially durg that time now the same housekeeper though also testified that she saw a mysterious black car outside of the house a few days before the murders on one occasion the car was the alley behd the house the driver was starg to the garage other testimony focused more on physical evidence at the crime scene we see there was testimony about the tshirt that xxmaj darlie was wearg it was xxunk back together not all the holes the tshirt led up her wounds specifically there are four holes the shirt that did n't have a xxunk wound makg it look like she took the shirt off caused the wounds then put the shirt back on now if she was tryg to get away these crimes it 's not clear why she would have done this it would have made more sense to the shirt on but either way that was a theory that we saw presented one of the other knives that butcher block the kitchen specifically a bread knife had some glass debris rubber dust on it that matched the material the garage wdow screen that was cut makg it look like xxmaj darlie cut the screen her own knife put it back now there were theories that those fibers were actually from a fgerprtg brush that 's a possibility it was n't really clearly established either way now there was a broken we glass on the floor darlie 's blood was found under the glass now clearly the glass could have been moved by all the first responders gog out of the house so i do n't thk that was particularly powerful evidence we see efforts were made to clean the kitchen sk the countertop front of the sk traces of blood were found on the countertop so that does n't look so good for xxmaj darlie then we see testimony about blood splatter we see an expert testified xxmaj darlie could have been the murder based on how the splatter hit the front of her shirt the back of her shirt the defense poted out that her blood was mixed her son 's blood on that shirt now we see testimony about how the alleged assailant acted a way that no other assailant would act the prosecution said that he would not have cut the screen he would not have killed an anger he would not have left a witness so really they 're sayg the way this crimal operated made no sense well often crimals do n't make a lot of sense right the crimes are irrational regardless of who committed them i thk this is kd of a weak prosecutorial strategy so they 're lookg at this event sayg no one would do this yet somebody did do it they were accusg somebody of dog it or they 're really tryg to say like well a crimal that breaks to houses would n't do this but somehow the mother of sons would do this so aga no matter how they want to frame it they 're sayg that it was an unusual crime so a sense i thk they 're kd of buildg reasonable doubt toward the defendant as well as toward the alleged assailant that the defendant said was there now lookg through the transcript of the trial the defense never brought up the idea that xxmaj darren could have committed the crime now i do n't thk he did but that strategy could have created reasonable doubt right especially because the kd of ruled out every suspect the world except for xxmaj darlie xxmaj darren even still i thought the defense did a good job i thought they presented what seemed like an effective closg potg out that xxmaj james cron sealed darlie 's fate by declarg there was no truder soon after arrivg on the scene i thought that was a very good pot we see general the defense really hammered the xxunk vestigation that occurred either way though xxmaj february 17 xxmaj darlie was convicted of murderg xxmaj damon was sentenced to death she has not been tried the death of xxmaj devon so evidently the jury did feel that the prosecution met its burden now sce beg convicted xxmaj darlie has filed many appeals some are still xxunk we see that xxmaj dar divorced xxmaj darlie 2011 it 's now movg to the mental health personality characteristics so we see here that xxmaj darlie reported she had xxunk depression as well as anxiety evidently she had been depressed at the time of the murders there are some xxunk from a journal that seemed to dicate depression most notably on xxmaj may 3 16 she wrote a suicide note to her children at trial she said it was not significant now if that was the motive right if she wanted to end her own life why did she plant the sock the sock was really xxunk that would have helped her defense she would n't need a defense if she was dead we also see that xxmaj darlie was trustg she went talked to the police out an attorney which of course is always a bad idea there 's no good reason to talk to the police if you 're a suspect an vestigation we see that she did not appear really to be a crimal mastermd right so when lookg at this evidence like the sock beg planted some distance away i do n't know if she really would have thought of that there 's nothg really clear from kd of watchg the videos readg through the transcripts that dicated she was thkg that way like she had that capability also she had no history of violence no history of psychopathy i do n't really see much the way of psychopathy at all some of me the argument that maybe she was narcissistic like she was materialistic arrogant well a lot of people are like that even if she was like that not tied to murder we also see this argument that her grievg was appropriate like the silly strg tape this is one of the thgs that a great xxunk the most about how these cases are vestigated the idea there 's a right way or an appropriate way to grief a highly unusual situation this is the type of circumstance that few people will ever experience two children beg murdered nobody knows how they would react to that even if one could make the argument that her way of grievg was xxunk different than other people that still does n't pot to guilt now movg over to the police the prosecution here we see a lot of terestg factors what really sts out to me is the lack of any type of critical thkg skills or a cognitive reasong ability i thk what happened here is they needed to believe somethg they came right there they needed a belief that xxmaj darlie was guilty there 's also the sense that they 're really kd of lazy the vestigation they did not follow up like they did n't vestigate the story about that suspicious vehicle it 's like if they were to do that they 're reducg their chances of makg sure that xxmaj darlie is found guilty right so their mission is n't to fd xxmaj darlie guilty their mission is to fd the truth i thk sometimes that gets lost when talkg about these types of vestigations we also see this theory that the vestigators were narcissistic so aga just makg a xxunk examation declarg that everythg has been figured out celebratg when xxmaj darlie was arrested right it 's not a happy occasion it 's not a time for high fives a bunch of fun now we see that the vestigators were not proficient at conductg an vestigation so a situation like this i 'd probably say more readg would be helpful more trag less just kd of actg impulsively gog one 's gut i thk there was a lot of confirmation bias occurrg here they locked on to a conclusion then they found the evidence to support that conclusion stead of lettg the evidence guide them to the conclusion we see a lot of flawed thkg this vestigation so like distorted thoughts like everythg that deviates from normal is bad or worse yet everythg that deviates from normal is crimal we see that there was this belief that no one would grab a knife from a victim 's kitchen well ard xxmaj ramirez xxmaj night xxmaj stalker did this several times he committed 13 murders before he was caught right so aga i 'm left the impression that these vestigators did n't spend a lot of time readg about other cases now another thg that strikes me here is perhaps these vestigators were fluenced by the xxmaj susan xxmaj smith case this occurred about a xxunk before we see a young mother xxmaj union xxmaj south xxmaj carola who murdered her two sons of course xxmaj susan xxmaj smith would later confess so perhaps these vestigators really wanted to kd of move thgs ahead they want to get ahead of the curve just jump to the conclusion that xxmaj darlie must have been guilty so it 's possible we saw a lot of illogical reasong here so lookg at this case what about the idea of xxmaj darlie beg guilty or not guilty which one makes more sense well the stard a crimal proceedg xxmaj texas the rest of the xxmaj united xxmaj states is the person has to be guilty beyond a reasonable doubt i thk clearly xxmaj darlie is not guilty beyond a reasonable doubt it 's actually frighteng to me that a jury could come up any other verdict but not guilty this case this stard beyond a reasonable doubt can be quantified roughly as 85 to 0 percent sure so they were about 85 0 percent certa that she was guilty there 's no way that they could have been that certa that really just amazes me now movg over to guilt nocence this is a different concept right so guilty not guilty or concepts on the law guilt or nocence is more like if we could see the perfect truth of somethg the absolute truth was darlg guilty or nocent well all my concerns about this case there are many i have many concerns about what happened here i still thk it 's more likely than not that she 's guilty i would say the probability is somewhere between 55 to % on the side that she 's guilty well below the reasonable stard but still more likely than not so here i 'll look at the factors potg toward guilt the factors potg toward nocence so the factors potg toward guilt we see xxmaj darlie hled the murder weapon right all thgs beg equal this is a bad sign if the suspect hles the murder weapon that does n't look good the murder weapon was not troduced from the outside it was from her kitchen certaly possible but aga it pots more toward guilt she had recently demonstrated a desire to end her own life so that shows a degree of despair that could be consistent murder the alleged assailant left behd no evidence that could identify him the fibers from the screen on the bread knife that looks suspicious why would an assailant come from the outside kill her sons failed to kill her why did she clean the countertop the sk her story changed several times she also claimed not to remember thgs that she had previously remembered there are not many good reasons that her story should have changed if she were nocent so now let 's look at factors potg toward nocence well of course the frighteng level of competence demonstrated by the vestigators we never really got to see if there were any other good suspects right so aga that 's quite disturbg the crime as she described it is consistent an assailant who was tent on assaultg her sexually this would expla why he would have murdered the children left her alive so that particular type of assailant her story does make sense we see really no good explanation for the sock that was found 75 yards away from her house also i fd it hard to believe that she would leave that anybody would fd that sock there 's no evidence here that she had experience forensic vestigation i mean she could 've left that sock there wondered if anybody ever would have found it right but it became kd of a key part of her defense so the sock kd of pots toward nocence this case we see no apparent motive if her motive was to collect the five thous dollars life surance why did n't she target xxmaj dar his policy was worth $ 800,000 if she did have some reason to kill her sons why did n't she kill all three right it 's hard to thk of what reason there would be just to kill two but not to kill all three xxmaj damon was alive when the police arrived right so xxmaj darlie was not a medical expert of any type there 's no reason to believe that she knew how long xxmaj damon would live she did n't know for sure he would die before he reached the hospital why would she take that chance why would he have still been alive when the first responders arrived also this case we see no confession xxmaj darlie has always mataed her nocence so brgg everythg together this was a tragic case that was poorly vestigated there 's so much formation that we should have but we do not have it 's a testament to how easy it is to be convicted of a crime out sufficient evidence how difficult it is to xxunk a conviction that should have never happened this case also highlights a lot of flaws the justice system we see this entry pot for xxmaj darlie to the justice system pretty much for anybody is the police yet the police use a different set of rules then we see the courts there is no reasonable doubt stard police as they vestigate crimes so if the police officer kd of locks on or a detective kd of locks on to a suspect starts aga havg that confirmation bias that leads the suspect gettg the court where yes they have more rights there but beg there puts them jeopardy right so that 's kd of the first domo the police once that domo falls all the other xxunk can fall when lookg at the crimal justice system we see a lot of xxunk professionals like attorneys judges porg over thouss of pages of documents readg references from the law to come up these different theories different opions it does seem to work pretty well but all that work is based on potentially police officers makg a decision a couple seconds aga it 's not based on any critical reasong skills so seems like a lot of the thkg power is kd of expended the courts not enough is expended kd of out the field that early stage of the vestigation my last pot for this conclusion we see that many people correctly assign value to how people react durg times of severe stress i 've seen this a number of cases i reviewed it 's really not somethg that 's logical people are placg a lot of meang somethg that could have absolutely no meang right so of course potentially it has meang but it 's not consistent her reaction could have dicated guilt it could have dicated nocence we have no way of distguishg which one xxmaj italy pots to i know whenever i talk about controversial cases there will be a variety of opions please put any opions thoughts the comment section they always generate an terestg dialogue as always i hope you found my analysis of this topic to be terestg thanks for watchg,xxbos you is exercise important heart disease cancer diabetes one of the thgs they all have common is they can be affected by obesity the first recorded heart attack this country was 186 186 this country you had to get exercise to go to the bathroom everybody lived on farms but we got smart we start buildg maches to help us get our work done we moved to the cities start pushg buttons for a livg pushg the wrong button could really create a lot of stress we started noticg that people startg to die from xxunk the arteries by the xxmaj korean xxmaj war half the soldiers averagg 1 years of age heal durg that war showed significant xxunk of coronary arteries 156 the xxmaj eisenhower admistration had a big meetg xxmaj washgton xxup dc the military is noticg somethg funny startg to happen it was becomg creasgly difficult to fd young xxmaj american men who could pass the xxunk xxunk for the military they wanted to figure out who to blame what 's the problem they looked to the public schools some researchers had done fitness tests volvg the ability of our students at the high school junior high school level to perform what they call functional movements just everyday thgs you might have to do on your job or your lives like can you bend over you touch your toes you know at 16 years of age you should be able to put your toes your mouth we thought that was the dumbest idea anybody ever came up the test kids for physical fitness because we thought the kids are fit just because you 're young xxunk pot eight percent of our kids fail that test we said that ca n't be right if that 's true we have the most xxunk kids world folks that 's just not possible so they decide to take the test the kids give it to kids xxmaj europe seven percent fail ah they xxunk that test all over the world could not fd another group of kids on the planet they had anywhere close to a seven percent failure rate on that test a 57 percent failure on that test the came back started what eventually became the xxmaj president 's xxmaj council on physical fitness sports f over 0 years now everywhere you turn somebody 's gog to put you your kids on exercise programs then we got another bright idea why do n't we check to see how fit we 've become forty percent of us are still enthusiastically avoidg exercise fifty percent are exercisg still lousy shape about 10 percent of keepg fit xxmaj university xxmaj indiana measured the fitness level the four million kids between six 17 years of age found the middle of all this xxunk about exercise 57 % of our kids are still failg fitness test fitness leaders say they 're worse now than they were thirty years ago we 're fdg 1 to 0 old kids 0 % block at the coronary arteries which used to be called adult onset diabetes not showg up kids between 10 years of age they say we 're raisg the first generation that will have a shorter life expectancy than either their parents or grparents it has never before happened our history the state of xxmaj oregon has the highest rate of obesity of any state west of the xxmaj rockies our public schools are beg gutted because of budget cuts the first thg we always cut is physical education they formed an xxmaj oregon health policy xxmaj commission to tell us how to solve this problem they published a 65 page report which basically said we do n't know what they said this children 's behaviors are substantially affected by the fluential adults their lives parents grparents teachers efforts to address childhood obesity xxmaj oregon will not be successful unless they also clude terventions that fluence the healthy eatg physical activity behaviors of adults as well as children now they xxunk this message down a bit their fal draft but the idea was out how many of you get all the exercise you need if not why not well the two most common xxunk are what do you thk it is number one i do n't have time every time we 've asked i do n't have time number two this surprised me how often they stayed how boldly they stated was i 'm too lazy to do it even when i do have time or the way the way one can head to xxmaj south xxmaj carola said it i swear after college i 'd never sweat aga let 's just call it lack of motivation but every time we the medical fitness field have been bold enough to ask why do n't you do it you 've been credibly honest you 've been credibly consistent you said two thgs xxwrep 4 over aga i do n't have time i do n't know how to stay motivated to exercise you would thk all medical fitness leaders who cared would have scheduled a national convention somewhere got to a big room said let 's just solve these two problems it has never happened as fitness leaders we are not traed to deal i do n't have time i do n't know how to stay motivated to exercise almost changed my major the xxmaj university of xxmaj north xxmaj carola when i heard some guys xxmaj california say exercise that my wife is to take a bath pull the plug fight the current what they teach us to say is ya got ta make exercise fun he ever heard that it 's all over the place make it fun make it folks over the past thirty ne years i 've put over ten thous xxmaj americans on exercise programs i 'm here to tell you i 've learned a lot about exercise one of the thgs i 've learned is if what you 're dog for exercise is fun i guarantee you you 're not dog it right there are physiological requirement that must be met order to benefit from your exercise program whether you like it or not the tensity the duration the frequency of your exercise are all more important than whether or not it 's fun you must work every muscle the body the cardiovascular system flexibility muscle balance muscle strength there 's no sgle activity or exercise that we know of that adequately works your total body if you do n't sit down design a total body workout it is n't gog to happen so how do you solve this problem well i got to meet dr . mark xxmaj angel dr . mark xxmaj angel has a dual professorship at xxmaj middle xxmaj tennessee xxmaj state xxmaj university xxmaj murfreesboro i do a professorship the department of psychology xxmaj health xxmaj human xxmaj performance he wrote an article xxunk a new fitness major he was gog to call applied exercise psychology which would have been what i xxunk had it existed when i was school but basically what he had done is wrote an article to the xxmaj journal of the board of sports psychology explag what he saw was justification for this new fitness major explas the problems he saw physical fitness it almost exactly mirrored what i 've been speakg on for over thirty years to the pot where i wanted to meet this guy so i flew back to xxmaj xxunk drove down to xxmaj murfreesboro looked him up his office went up to him gave a great big bear hug said you 're my hero he called for security know it no that did n't happen but but i explaed them what i was dog he was so appreciative of that i has a new book out promised to send me a new copy which i have n't gotten yet um but but what he basically said is this this fitness problem is more about our mental failures that our physical failures it 's more about your head your attitude than it is about your body he said you just ca n't decide to exercise have a susta you for the rest of your life so your bras gon na fight you you say i want to start an exercise program your bra says what are you dog have n't we been down this road look at you look at your dog but he says you have to w the mental balance it 's tough one guy said he got his car decided to go to the health club he got down to the tersection the light turned red he said that 's a sign turn around went back home but if you can w the mental battle for five consecutive years you will never go back to your previously sedentary lifestyle but you got to keep it up how do you w the psychological battle associated gettg ourselves to exercise well make it just that a lifestyle it become has to become a habit now we know that rather than workg out every day excuse me seven to three days a week the way we 've been taught workg out seven days a week or xxmaj gordon xxmaj american xxmaj college of xxmaj sports xxmaj medice worked out most days or every day i should thank you i 've been sayg that for over thirty years see it 's easy to work out everyday than it is to work out three days a week three days a week gives you too many decisions xxmaj monday xxmaj wednesday xxmaj friday mmhmm xxmaj tuesday xxmaj thursday xxmaj saturday can i skip the day double up tomorrow folks if you 're negotiatg about whether or not to work out it 's over do you work out first thg the morng you have a 300 percent greater chance of gettg it done than at any other time of day because you have more control over your schedule for stay the morng than any other time of day try to xxunk your workout time to 20 mutes or less the more time you spend exercisg the less likely you are to do it then we 're likely you are to get jured we 'll keep you from dog it anyway then work agast resistance if you work agast resistance you get tired faster now the most important rule exercise physiology is called the overload prciple it says no benefit occurs any exercise program until you get tired the problem is as you get more fit what happens to the amount of work you have to do to get tired it goes up the public schools they did xxmaj studies on high school boys asked them to do as many pushups they could every day until they get got tired do that every day for a year the boys you can do five pushups on the first day after year we 're dog between 100 120 to get to the same level of fatigue that five got it on the first day we 're talkg xxunk xxunk even if you do have time so then we say we 'll just go on a diet well folks the quickest way i know to get an xxmaj american fat is to go on a diet do n't ever diet another day the rest of your life eat for nutrition never eat for weight loss never make any change the way you eat that you 're not willg to make permanent now there 's a lot more i want to talk about nutrition but for lack of time let 's just concentrate on on physical fitness today so seven days a week first day the morng fan to spend about 20 mutes or less then work agast resistance so that as you become more fit you do n't spend more time you work agast more resistance so how do you do that well i was speakg to the xxmaj university xxmaj xxunk xxmaj club xxmaj seattle one of the members came up when i was done said i 'm one of the editors for prentice hall publishg we 're the largest publishg company xxmaj america we have a waitg list of people that want to write books on exercise nobody is tellg us how to stay motivated what you told us here today makes more sense than anythg i 've heard anywhere the country we do a book for my company on fitness motivation i said sure that was 30 years ago they have n't gotten motivated to do it yet but what i said was this the problem xxmaj fitness is we do n't know what xxmaj fitness is the reason we do n't know what xxmaj fitness is is because there 's no such thg as generic xxmaj fitness fitness is activity specific until you defe what you 're tryg to get fit for the term has no meang i 've traed xxmaj portl xxmaj trailblazers not change xxmaj seattle xxmaj xxunk i 've traed realestate agents i traed xxunk totally different approach to fitness dependg on what i 'm tryg to get done that fitness program so what is the most universal appeal i can make for physical fitness i came down this health exercise beg called the best medice xxmaj america today outperformg almost every prescribed medication the country terms of its overall impact on our health everythg from colds flu to cancer is beg impacted by exercise but you ca n't just pay lip service to the idea you actually have to do it so how much fitness do we need order to be healthy i said no problem i 'll go through the experts i went to the medical school library xxmaj portl look up how fit you have to be to stay healthy for the most part to fd virtually nothg written on the subject some formation on aerobic exercise but other than that there was nothg there so i would n't talk xxunk that i had known read about asked him they 're defition about physical fitness they 're already tests norms that had been established for the components that could make up total physical fitness but nobody ever packaged it said this is the level of fitness he wanted to have so that 's exactly what i did i put together what i could tend it was a level of fitness sufficient to stay healthy for 1 years took my defition around the medical societies college physiology departments tryg to get somebody to disagree me the date have not found one disagreement on one item on my test so i turned it to a busess that 's still gog now eaverton xxmaj oregon then i wanted to get it even out farther to the general public so i got on the speaker circus your attention is your own public how to measure their own physical fitness that will be sufficient to impact your health both physical mental health by the way the test which you 'll believe will have a copy of later as this here 's your test that you can do at home i want you to be flexible enough to sit on the floor your legs straight reach your fgertips at least five ches past your toes most men can touch your toes some of you have n't seen them five years why it 's flexibility that big a deal because one of the leadg cause is not showg up at work xxmaj america is my back hurts 85 % of the back pa xxmaj america today is beg traced to people tight back muscles caused by weak stomach muscles because you sit so much when the stomach muscles go on vacation the back muscles have to work overtime they xxunk up you bend over to pick up a xxunk on you off work for six weeks strengthen your abdomal muscles stretch your lower back an 85 percent of an 80 to 100 billion dollar problem will either lessen or go away completely but none of you can strengthen your

xxunk step you just failed the test 75 % of the people this room if your typical will fail that test a lot of your runners do n't have good cardiovascular fitness but no has been able expla that to you that test will it 's not my test i did n't make it up it 's out there beg used by the research community then fally keep track of your body fat one lady started a 15 mile a week joggg program a light weight trag hopg to lose weight she gaed eight pounds but dropped six dress sizes because muscle is heavy fat takes up less space this is a sk fold caliper i 've been takg it everywhere i go every time i speak for over 30 years it measures your subcutaneous body fat have to xxunk your body or directly beneath the sk i can xxunk the xxunk of your sk the upper back the xxunk for men upper arm the waistle for women i can fairly actually tell you how much body fat you have women should n't carry more than 20 % men no more than 15 % if you 're carryg more than that you tend to be more prone to everythg from colds flu the cancer by the way for you researchers this is xxmaj xxunk 's formula that i 'm usg for xxunk xxunk i 'll be happy to stay around at the end of the day do body fat percentages for anybody wants to have that done the quickest way i know to clear the room if you do n't have a sk fold caliper keep track of your body shape if you 're losg ches but you 're not losg pounds what are you losg fat that 's a good thg so keep track of your shape for men you should at least drop your keep track of your waistle if you 're droppg body fat you almost always a drop the waistle measurement for men it 's excuse me for women it 's the hip measurement keep track of a hip measurement i found if you 're droppg body fat you almost always are droppg the hip measurement so

              "xxbos [ ] hi my name is dr . i 'm a licensed psychologist the state of xxmaj texas expert the area of personality disorders because xxmaj october is depression xxmaj awareness xxmaj month i thought i would make a video on depression borderle personality disorder i thk the most important thg to know is that depression is different for those who are diagnosed borderle personality disorder we 're gog to talk about that today we 're gog to talk about how it 's different what those similarities are what makes it complex as well as medication for depression how that tends to impact those borderle personality disorder treatment so let 's get started i hope you enjoy the video so first thg what 's important is that a lot of folks that have are diagnosed borderle personality disorder as well as those traits or at high likelihood to experience depression now when we talk about depression we 're not talkg about sadness sadness is very different sadness tends to be short term tends to be trigger specific which is there somethg that has xxunk you which could be loss of a relationship thgs like that but it does n't last for weeks at a time it does n't impact your ability to function throughout the day okay when one starts to do those thgs lasts for a long time impacts your relationships your ability to go to work or school connect other folks then we 're talkg about depression depression just like borderle personality disorder is also on a contuum okay so you can have mild moderate severe extreme depressive symptoms so the complexity borderle personality disorder it 's really common to see it those that have borderle personality disorder as well as treats now what the research shows is that 83 % of those that are diagnosed borderle personality disorder also meet criteria for major depressive disorder that goes to our depression not sadness but goes to depression which means that it does impact what 's called socioeconomic dysfunction or cause of socioeconomic dysfunction which is that ability to relate to others connect sometimes it 's hygiene issues takg care of yourself sleepg depression a lot of people thk that depression is just sort of a very xxunk dropped mood there is also what 's called xxunk depression an xxunk depression that is when people are very xxunk frustrated xxunk a lot of times you see depression what 's called anxious distress that is that they have all this energy that 's pent up energy it 's a frustrated type of energy but there 's a depressive xxunk to it it 's really complex it that would take a complete video on its own to talk just about depression how that teracts xxunk i want to stay consistent borderle personality disorder here because i thk this is really important a lot of mental health providers are also confused by it certaly the presentation those who do n't specialize personality stores can be very confusg so let 's try to simplify some of that now so when we talk about borderle personality disorder major depressive disorder there is significant symptom overlap the symptoms overlap what happens is is that those borderle personality disorder that they tend to have a xxunk presentation that xxunk depressive symptoms okay certaly suicide risk selfharm which is also seen those a major depressive disorder there 's affective stability those borderle personality disorder traits this this manifests because of talkg about depression that overlap that 's an tense xxunk xxunk okay when we see a borderle personality sorter but also you can see some of that what we remember we talked about anxious distress you can see that as well because you can see folks that are presentg this very xxunk xxunk sad xxunk presentation but it 's frequent temper outbursts these folks xxunk irritability this this xxunk that major depressive disorder anxious distress okay dividuals borderle first now i sort of tend to experience senses of emptess which is all commonly reported those major depressive disorder then there 's also the xxunk paranoia for some of those folks that are on that borderle personality order spectrum they have dissociative symptoms this xxunk depressive psychotic features at times now depression psychotic features that is those that are so depressed that they start to xxunk that can often be confused some mental health providers can be confused thk that it is xxunk delusion it 's actually two societal xxunk xxunk so we have to educate ourselves certaly as mental health providers but also as dividuals that experience this disorder so that sometimes we have to clarify what symptoms were actually seeg we 're gog to talk more about that just a mute okay so vote back that 's that symptom overlap well depression borderle personality disorder but it 's not actually a depressive disorder some cases so let 's talk about that real briefly so now we know that depressive symptoms because 83 % depressive symptom cur occur those borderle personality disorder this but those would borderle personality sort if it 's not depression okay so now we 're gon na step outside of major depressive disorder this is for folks that just have borderle personality disorder okay not just like i 'm xxunk it but just that it 's not comorbid which means it occurs together major depressive sort borderle personality disorder so these are just folks that only have borderle personality disorder if they do n't have major depressive disorder what you see is you 'll see an xxunk stressor okay this is an stance which could be rejection perceived abonment some type of issue but what happens is once that episode that xxunk stressor xxunk or xxunk which means that it goes away it xxunk you see that those depressive symptoms that depressive presentation also xxunk starts to lessen okay so you 're seeg it me it 's more xxunk based than it is long term for extended episodes or periods of time so that is how we know that someone borderle personality disorder does not also have major depressive disorder now that does n't mean right remember because they 're on xxmaj contuum 's we 're not talkg xxunk okay that there are changes but that 's what we look for as mental health providers for those that have borderle personality disorder when there 's an xxunk trigger those xxup pd tend to experience or tend to present emptess you can have creased xxunk which is what we talked about a mute ago but when that trigger or that episode i do n't use the word episode when that trigger or that issue that caused that sense of rejection abonment when that is resolved so maybe the relationship xxunk or the fear is then attenuated or xxunk those depressive symptoms go away it okay but now what happens dividuals xxup pd depression these symptoms can can it can be an issue related to the communication the feelgs about a lot of folks borderle personality or have issues expressg their emotions communicatg them clearly this can clude anger frustration xxunk disappotment all those other thgs so a lot of times what we see part of this confusion for mental health providers as well as for yourself for yourself if you 're experiencg xxup pd or if you have a loved one or someone you know who has this is that they do n't communicate their emotions well they have this this difficulty dog that okay so these states do n't respond what happens is is that they may go to their general primary care physician they may report well you know i 've had this loss of a loved one whether it could be death that were end of a relationship whatever it may be so you go to your primary care physician let 's say or even a psychiatrist you report these episodes these these criteria you start to expla it they 're like oh well this person 's obviously depressed hey now they do n't know about those other xxunk they do n't know about the nuances overlaps other factors that we 're just gettg to so they diagnose there their patient depression they give them medication the problem is is that the medication does n't really xxunk those symptoms okay we 're gog to talk more about this just a little bit so what happens is is that we have to educate the dividuals by therapy is so important for those borderle personality disorder because we have to teach these folks all right well we have to learn how to communicate our feelgs if you 're one of those dividuals that you have trouble kd of expressg your feelgs i do have an emotions exercise on my website you 're welcome to download try it to try to build up your emotional telligence skills your communication of emotions which is really important because if you have these seemgly depressive episodes that are trigger related okay then you need to be able to communicate that to identify those emotions specifically that trigger if this is confusg we 're gon na keep talkg about it to try to clarify it for you but it is a confusg process even for mental health providers so if you 're confused it 's understable okay so let me just simplify really quick so we 're talkg about is that the confusion for the dividual as well as the provider of care for those xxup dpd is that the dividual xxup pd has trouble effectively communicatg their emotions they 've experienced a trigger or loss so they start to express certaly feel are managg dealg these depressive like symptoms but they do n't qualify for major depressive disorder which is where medication is helpful okay so let 's let 's keep gog because there 's even more of a question this goes to the complexity a lot of folks who who write me stuff underst because they 're livg the complexity of xxup pd okay it is complex it 's but it 's not a lost cause i always try to add that is that this is a xxunk disorder it really really is let 's go a little further because it used to be believed that borderle personality was what 's called an affective disorder an affective disorder that would be your depression all right you also have an effect an emotional component right so they used to believe that xxup pd was like bipolar sorter i 've contemplated dog a video just on bipolar disorder i 'm not gog to get to bipolar disorder here because of all the details that 's that that 's that that is composed of bipolar the difference between borderle but i 'll lightly touch on it here so that you have some clarity so what happens is xxup pd is often confused as an affective disorder this could be bipolar or depression but what happens is if the proof is the treatment of depression does not lessen those xxup pd symptoms okay so let 's say you have an dividual who has major depressive disorder that is comorbid till they occur together xxup pd that dividual goes to their psychiatrist their primary care physician they get let 's say xxmaj xxunk or an xxup xxunk or another medication for depression what will happen is is you may see those depressive symptoms xxunk or lessen but the xxup pd stuff still is present those xxunk that xxunk that anger that emptess that chronic emptess that fear of abonment those other factors do n't xxunk they do n't go away medication okay so that 's that 's a big dicator all right that what we 're talkg about is xxup pd that could be comorbid or could not be major depressive disorder goes for bipolar as well you 'll see that those manic phases xxunk phases those depressive episodes become attenuated or controlled or steady but you still have those reactions those those xxup pd feelgs other types of factors we 're gog to talk a little bit more about medication xxunk of symptoms just a mute okay so but here 's what 's terestg this is what the research shows is that treatment for depression does n't lower xxup pd symptoms but xxup pd treatment treatment for xxup pd xxunk depressive symptoms right i mean thk about it because the manifestation of those depressive symptoms comes from xxup pd if you deal xxup pd you can man to the but if you just treat the depression it does n't lessen the xxup pd because the xxup pd is a larger component that is over the depression okay i 'm gon na get more to it so do n't do n't get frustrated be like what the hell is this guy talkg about i 'm gon na clarify as we keep gog okay so what 's terestg is so we also want to talk about early experiences okay i 'm gon na dump xxunk a little bit talk about those xxup pd that have these early experiences the early environments for a lot of folks xxup pd but not just xxup pd okay that have had secure attachment patterns combed anxious sensitive temperament later childhood trauma which could be abused psychological abuse emotional abuse other types of abuse factors that may xxunk dividuals to xxup pd early onset depressive disorder as well as assignment disorder now xxunk disorder is so here 's depression when we talk about a severity that xxunk disorder is not as severe but it 's this contual sort of feelg all right there 's no other way to describe it then folks who just feel blue they do n't get excited about anythg everythg seems kd of very xxunk there this is not meant to be humorous it 's meant to be as an example but there used to be similar on xxmaj saturday xxmaj night xxmaj live called debbie xxunk so debbie xxunk she presented somethg similar to dis xxunk disorder never really happy tends to be xxunk negative tends to not enjoy thgs a lot of xxmaj xxunk which is that you do n't enjoy thgs you do n't enjoy experiences you have you tend not to you tend to lose terest thgs you want to enjoy but this happens for a longer period of time but it 's not as severe as your major depressive disorder okay so let 's let 's keep gog so now we 've talked about early early experiences let 's talk about medication because this this is very tricky the xxmaj united xxmaj states seventy percent of all actually of the world 's medications consumed the xxmaj united xxmaj states what 's terestg as far as medication is that there is limited research that actually shows evidence for the use of xxunk or is like xxunk xxunk or xxunk fatty acids the management of depression as it is a component of xxup pd okay but the problem is is there 's no real solid data on how to guide clicians or xxunk or primary care physicians choosg a specific treatment for depression that is comorbid xxup pd okay now there is creasg pressure right around the world okay about the limited use of medication for xxup pd okay because of its limited effectiveness concerns about obesity which is an issue a lot of times medication other types of health problems can occur due to long term takg medication that you need to talk to your doctor about when we have an dividual borderle personality disorder that also has these comorbid disorders we 're just talkg about major depressive disorder this video okay so what happens is is that you do n't have a xxunk of your xxup pd symptoms so you go back to your doctor okay you say well i mean you know nothg 's really change i 'm still depressed i 'm still xxunk i still have what we 're callg anxious to stress you know so what happens is they give you another medication on top of the other medication this is called xxunk okay so but if you 've listened to my other videos you 've heard me talk about core structure surface structure that 's exactly what we 're talkg about now surface structure would be your depressive episodes features criterion components your core structure is that xxup pd is that borderle personality disorder your core structure a drives or impacts your surface structure okay which this case we 're talkg major depressive disorder now if you can xxunk you have to deal surface structure behavior but that core structure is still present so therapy because medication addresses surface structure does not address core structure it would be great if we have medication for personality but we do n't so that 's why treatment this is research been done sce the 50 that has been found more xxunk than medication even as medications get better now i 'm not sayg do n't take your medication please do n't you have to talk to your psychiatrist or your primary care physician this is not a video about should you take your medication at all you need to talk to a mental health provider or a medical provider any time your thk about changg your medication that 's really important because you 're dealg your bra your body you do n't want to have different types of side effects xxunk reactions if you make those choices okay so let 's just be clear about that so when we talk about xxunk now what happens is is that you 're gettg medications aga so first surface structure your medications are beg prescribed to deal these different components xxunk depression loss of terest lack of ve other types of factors so this xxunk starts to occur which is you 're gettg prescribed different medications for different symptoms so now you can have four or five i 've had clients that were on ne different medications to deal symptom presentations related to xxup pd now it does n't mean they were n't comorbid anxiety xxup ptsd other thgs but their core structure of xxup pd kept drivg this surface structure i really hope that this is makg its own i know it 's complex so it 's tryg to go slow be clear so xxunk now this tends to occur aga because you go to your doctor you 're distress that 's alright right you want somethg to feel better your your doctor wants to help you right so they 're driven to try to manage alleviate these symptoms as best they can right so as you present more symptoms they are identifyg other medications that might be able to help you okay now one study found that compared people that just had depression people borderle personality disorder were twice as likely to have taken xxunk two times more likely to have received an xxunk medication more than six times likely to have received mood xxunk there are more than ten times likely to have use xxunk okay so that says a lot that goes right back to the client example i gave you is that you 're presentg different symptoms your doctor wants to help you they 're driven to help you they keep seeg the symptom presentation so they 're dressg each of those symptoms different medications okay but the core structure stays which is why therapy is so important okay what this means is is that you want to explore your options your doctor do your best to have a treatment team if you can okay so as a psychologist i have talked to primary care physicians xxunk we have been a treatment team sometime of two sometimes three to help this dividual get stable function as you build these abilities to manage defe underst your emotions then you become more xxunk xxunk which is which is my goal for a lot of my clients the xxmaj hat personality sorter is an empowerment sight you need less medication because you 're buildg these skills to manage it but they 're beg treated by a psychiatrist by myself as well sometimes there 's a case work or sometimes as a social worker sometimes there 's a licensed professional counselor an xxup xxunk so that we 're helpg this dividual build these skills teract appropriately the medication is not needed as much so you can start to lessen some of those over time perhaps they go away you do n't need the medication now that 's some cases aga you do n't want to do this on your own you want to do it metal medical providers mental health providers who actually know can help you give you the support that you need order to do that okay so let 's talk about a little more we 're about medication or therapy okay so no research has shown that major depressive xxunk is not a significant predictor for outcome of xxup pd we talked about that right is that if you treat depression that does n't lessen those borderle personality sort of symptoms criteria other factors but borderle personality disorder is a significant predictor of outcome for major depressive disorder so if you treat the borderle personality disorder that can lessen successfully you start lessen some of those surface structures surface presentations issues that will lessen the depressive symptoms but xxunk the depressive symptoms say well personality source we 're not gog to worry about that we 're just gog to treat depression the xxup pd stuff still stays there you may have had that this experience okay is that you 're on different medications you 're like well it 's not changg all of this that 's because this is xxup pd but it 's changg this which is the depression okay so now these studies right so what they found is they recommended the treatment of borderle personality disorder hey psychotherapy what should happen is the priority so when you have this major depression you have xxup pd they cooccur so their comorbid when they occur together that the mental health provider the treatment provider the psychotherapy should n't focus on the depressive symptoms would focus on the components of xxup pd which goes back to dealg that core content stuff that we talked about as opposed to just dealg surface structure but i will say this as an aside if you have severe extreme high moderate depressive symptoms it tend not to show up for for therapy they 're too depressed they 're not motivated therapy tends to have no forward movement so that 's where medication can help a little bit you can xxunk some of those depressive symptoms enough to get the client or yourself motivated to come to treatment to deal the xxup pd because if we can control lessen the xxup pd we control lessen the major depressive disorder okay so now different psychotherapy xxmaj xxunk found to be really effective for borderle personality disorder there 's xxunk behavioral therapy there is xxup dt dialectical behavioral therapy there 's terpersonal therapy others that are found to be really effective okay to deal xxup pd lessen the symptoms of xxup pd get those under control okay so what we want to do is if these treatments this is for yourself as well these are some skills for you to build okay along your mental health provider if you ca n't afford it these are some skills that you can try to build on your own i have to xxunk my website there are different xxunk i have a workbook comg out next year 201 specifically related to my theory approach dividuals xxup pd on how you go through this how you first deal some of the surface structure buildg some skills then you go to your core content you start to address your core content control your core content build skills to manage it then how to achieve a matenance phase as well okay but so what we want to do is just briefly so what are some thgs that you can do okay so we want to build awareness of emotions so if you 're someone borderle personality disorder or someone you know has borderle personality so work on emotional xxunk okay so what is happess what is sadness what is anger what is frustration anger frustration are very different right now you can have frustration but then you have anger so there 's different levels buildg that understg so that the dividual borderle personality disorder they can say well i 'm frustrated stead a lot of folks xxup pd say i 'm xxwrep 4 angry but really there 's a nuance there buildg that differentiation between that is so important okay what we want to do is you want to not only build awareness of emotions itself but others then identify situations that trigger an emotional response so you underst not only yourself others situations this takes time i love xxmaj xxunk 's first book on emotional telligence i thk that it gives a lot of good examples i do n't thk he meant to do this but as a mental health provider when i read it i 'm like these are great techniques aga i have an emotional exercise on my website you can check that out build these skills the more you do it the better you 'll get at it another way to try it is like you can watch different youtube videos or different movies as you 're watchg it say what emotion what i say is there if it 's anger sadness whatever frustration maybe ask your partner or friend whoever 's you say what emotion would you say that is now you 're gettg some xxunk validity you 're givg yourself a little bit of emotional underst okay that 's important to do we want to do that so as you start to recognize your emotions it helps you to learn to control them okay now what we want to do is we want to as we 've talked here right this video is that we want to crease awareness of your emotions we also need to recognize that treatg depression tends not to when the researcher supports this does not xxunk xxup pd expressions but if you work on xxup pd expressions of just symptoms criteria other factors that has been found to lessen your depression okay that 's important these are important thgs your important skills awareness sight for you so that you can help to manage your condition or help a significant other or a child or someone you love that that 's experiencg these borderle personality xxunk as well as those traits hey so i really hope that this has been helpful for you i hope it was n't too much formation you know the the the video could really go for like four or five hours just on this topic that 's a really long youtube video so i to make it specific xxunk i hope that you enjoyed it if you like this video you 're welcome to check out some of my others i appreciate your your time attention thank you very much have a great day take care bye bye,xxbos ♪ ♪ > > i xxup

if you fd this video to be terestg or helpful please like it subscribe to my channel hello this is dr . gre today 's question asks if i can take a look at fantasies associated personality pathology i 've had a number of questions specifically about narcissistic antisocial person xxunk so i answer these questions a few different ways look at the personality disorders all ten of them go through just what types of fantasies we might expect those personality sorters then i 'll look at ten examples of cluster personality pathology fantasies so fantasy has an terestg place personality pathology counselg some counselg modalities clients talk about their fantasies what those fantasies mean to them they explore fantasy order to get to some sort of therapeutic benefit this is particularly common psychodynamic therapy therapies that are similar to psychodynamic most fantasies are harmless fantasizg is extraordarily common technically a fantasy is when somebody images somethg that is xxunk or impossible sometimes fantasies can lead to positive outcomes even though the fantasy itself can rarely be realized for example somebody might have a fantasy of becomg the best actor who has ever lived they might work hard at studyg actg gog to a lot of auditions they might become a good actor on the other h sometimes fantasies can terfere legitimate goals every now then fantasies can be destructive frighteng when it comes to personality pathology the personality characteristics that really st out terms of fantasy would come from cluster so that would be antisocial narcissistic borderle histrionic xxmaj personality xxmaj disorder z ' the level of fantasizg is so high narcissistic personality disorder that fantasizg is actually one of these symptom criteria fantasies of unlimited success power xxunk beauty or ideal love although as i 've said many times xxmaj prior videos i view the term unlimited as too restrictive here i prefer the term exaggerated because not every dividual xxup npd wants unlimited excess sometimes they just want a highly unrealistic quantity of success now the ma trait associated fantasy is openness to experience so if we look at this from the perspective of the five factor model if somebody is high openness to experience they are xxunk creative they tend to xxunk off to fantasy if we combe personality pathology relatively high openness to experience we get fantasies that may seem unusual some cases antisocial it 's important note here that there is a significant difference between havg a fantasy actg on a fantasy although the presence of troublg fantasies would dicate that counsellg would be a good idea many of the severe consequences troublg fantasies are realized when people try to make those fantasies to a reality so here i 'm gog to go through some of the fantasies that have been associated personality disorders then aga really xxunk down to cluster personality pathology give some specific examples when talkg about specific fantasies that i have become aware of formation has been changed to protect the nocent so as i mentioned fantasies are fairly common most of the 10 personality sellers have some relationship to fantasy just like all personality types would have some relationship so just quickly gog through the person is orders lookg at the fantasy type that might be associated that disorder from cluster a personality pathology paranoid person is order here we sometimes see fantasies of beg able to see know everythg to satisfy fears about beg spied on so somebody 's paranoid they may fantasize about beg able to detect when people are actually out to get them so they could have somethg like xray vision or an ability to read mds or just somethg that would let them know who 's tryg to cause harm to them movg one to schizoid i have n't noticed too much the way of fantasy this disorder dividuals this disorder tend to be xxunk to social situations they do n't often come for treatment so when i was kd of thkg through these 10 personal xxunk i really could n't come up a fantasy that 's specifically associated i ran to the same thg xxunk a xxunk perhaps there could be some fantasies here of beg accepted by others because of the social anxiety component we see sometimes what 's a typical but general i do n't really see this one strongly connected to fantasy now movg on to cluster personality pathology antisocial we see fantasies of committg gettg away crime fantasies of domation aga i 'll talk more about this cluster as i get to the different examples for cluster narcissistic we see fantasies about beg powerful wealthy beg admired by everybody the world about fdg a perfect romantic partner about controllg other people so we see some overlap here antisocial borderle we see fantasies of fdg one perfect mate who offers absolute security histrionic fantasies about beg popular beg the center of attention movg on to cluster c personality pathology startg avoidant sometimes here avoidant we see fantasies of havg close relationships now some of the time people thk about of xxmaj xxunk xxunk sort of they thk that somebody is tryg to avoid social situations because they do n't want to be close to people but usually people this disorder do want to have close relationships they just have a strong fear of embarrassment rejection dependent personality disorder we see fantasies of fdg one person that the dividual can really count on to support them so somewhat similar to borderle obsessivecompulsive personality order we see fantasies of a world where everybody can be productive everythg can be productive nobody 's tryg to terfere that productivity so we really see fantasies of everythg gog perfectly everythg runng smoothly so now centerg on cluster personality disorders i 'm really focusg here mostly on narcissistic to some extent antisocial to a lesser extent borderle histrionic what i 've noticed about narcissistic fantasies from my clical experience from the research literature is that there 's quite a bit of overlap these fantasies antisocial fantasies which actually makes a lot of sense given that we see a lot of cooccurrence between these two person these structures as well as comorbidity between the two personalities xxunk the dsm so narcissistic antisocial personality disorders the official diagnosis it 's unusual for a narcissist to have psychopathic tennessee 's it 's not unusual for a psychopath to have narcissistic tendencies at the xxunk clical level these traits hold together fairly well this has been xxunk the research on the dark triad the third trait of course beg xxmaj xxunk now the official personality disorders only capture certa aspects of psychopathy narcissism antisocial personality disorder really tends to capture impulsivity irresponsibility crimal components of psychopathy this is referred to as factor to psychopathy or sociopathy the diagnosis really does n't capture the superficial charm very well it does n't capture every aspect of the manipulation like we would see factor 1 psychopathy now a narcissistic personality xxunk tends to capture the griose side of narcissism characterized by domance confidence beg resistant to criticism extraversion it tends to miss vulnerable narcissism which is characterized by distrust shame xxunk xxunk a hyper sensitivity to criticism as we 'll see from these fantasies both factor 1 factor 2 psychopathy play a role both griose vulnerable narcissism play a role so all that md let 's get started the 10 examples of cluster personality fantasies these examples i 'm gog to alternate usg a male a female as the dividual who is havg the fantasy so the first fantasy is the fantasy of revenge here i 'm gog to start a male this fantasy is most associated psychopathy narcissism occasionally borderle especially when the dividual is seekg revenge on a love terest so this fantasy this could be revenge on people who rejected the dividual who bullied them xxunk them or who ignored them so lookg at the example here we see a man antisocial tendencies psychopathy who xxunk about how he will attack who bullied him when he was grade school or high school his fantasy he is really strikg fear to their hearts right so he targets the first dividual hurts them harms him some way potentially even kills them other people who bullied him start to see this like the news or somethg realize that he 's gog after everybody that bullied him so they 're trapped they ca n't really do anythg about it they 're stuck a lot of fear anxiety they 're unable to stop his xxunk so this fantasy he may have some type of super power we can xxunk law enforcement get away these crimes movg to the second example this is a fantasy of beauty so aga here i 'm movg to usg a female as the example this is associated narcissism to some extent borderle histrionic xxmaj personality pathology so at this example we see a woman who thks of herself as xxunk or average her fantasy she will suddenly be seen by others as beg exceedgly attractive so it 's not always about change the dividual but rather about change how other people view the dividual right so this example she 's not becomg more attractive she 's been attractive the whole time along people just ca n't recognize it there 's somethg blockg them from seeg it the fantasy of course is that obstacle is removed everybody realizes how beautiful she really is movg to the third fantasy this is the fantasy of md control this one is most closely associated narcissism borderle this is often to make somebody love the dividual to establish control or to escape responsibility so at the example here we see a man who commits an assault perhaps as part of another fantasy like a fantasy of revenge he 's arrested tried he uses his md control abilities to make sure the jury fds him not guilty so he 's xxunk of the assault but he 's only usg the md control on the members of the jury other people like the prosecutors the police they know he 's guilty right they 're not beg controlled so they would thk that he 's guilty the whole time along so essentially the dividual can xxunk xxunk the prosecutors the police confused them right how is he beg found not guilty by this jury when the facts clearly dicate that he committed these acts of revenge these assaults terestgly i 've actually seen this fantasy a number of times when i first heard this fantasy i kd of wondered why the fantasy was n't to have this xxunk ability over everybody volved like why even be arrested the first place right just xxunk the police be done it but there 's somethg xxunk to the narcissist or the psychopath to commit a crime for some people to know that he 's really guilty then get away it through his special ability whatever it is md control or some other ability it 's not really as entertag for this dividual unless they have this satisfaction of this group of people who aga kd of realize that somethg bad really happened the person 's gettg away it so that 's why i thk the md control these fantasies is often restricted to just a few people like 12 people jury for example movg to the fourth fantasy this is the fantasy of beg accepted by all those who rejected the dividual this is common narcissism borderle so the example here would be a woman who achieves a high level of popularity she becomes like a famous dividual this forces people who rejected her to admit her greatness beg for her forgiveness so now she 's able to hang out those people build all the friendships that she origally wanted so this one really is n't about revenge it 's about xxunk what the woman believes that she was entitled to the entire time along she wanted to be popular she wanted people to accept her they did n't this fantasy her becomg exceedgly popular or famous this can set that right this can make the people who rejected her realize the error of their ways so this aga kd of xxunk her back to where she wanted to be movg to fantasy number five this is a fantasy of dog somethg so helpful to society that people will admire the dividual this is often known as communal narcissism right of course this has a strong tie to narcissism not so much of course to antisocial borderle or histrionic so the fantasy example here would be a man starts a nonprofit to help the xxunk gets a great deal of media exposure everybody loves him for helpg people he seems like he is xxunk he is magnificent he 's an credible person who 's there to help xxmaj society now terestgly these fantasies of communal narcissism sometimes grow creasgly authentic meang they start to become selfcentered back toward what we normally thk of narcissism narcissism is often thought of it 's much more authentic than communal so these fantasies of communal narcissism might be popular kd of early somebody 's life but then aga become more selfcentered over time that will be reflected the newer versions of the fantasy fantasy number six is the fantasy of redemption success this is more common vulnerable narcissism borderle of course those two constructs have a lot of overlap between them so this one is really about beg falsely accused then xxunk so the example here a woman is accused of stealg money from a bank perhaps video surveillance that captures her removg money from a bank xxunk but it turns out that she actually prevented the theft perhaps she was movg the money from the bank xxunk to a place where would be safe so the real crimals could n't fd the money they were tryg to steal now this seems like an unusual fantasy but i 've also encountered this one several times i was really tryg to thk about why this fantasy occurs terms of my clical experience talkg to people the only thg i could really come up is that the movement is really tremendous when gog from beg hated to beg loved right so we thk about it on a scale where beg neutral havg people look at someone just thk really nothg about them that 's a zero beg hated would be a negative ten beg loved would be a ten what happens here at this fantasy is that somebody can go from negative ten all the way to ten stead of gog from zero to ten so it 's really about the change it 's the amount of change that occurs so the fantasy is more xxunk because now people really have to change their perception a great deal stead of just aga gog from neutral to likg the dividual so an unusual fantasy aga but i have seen this many times this xxmaj redemption success fantasy pattern fantasy number seven is a fantasy of beg chosen as great right so i see this mostly narcissism every now then psychopathy among all these fantasies that volve unlikely outcomes this one seems to be particularly unlikely yet like many of these i 've actually seen this particular fantasy quite a few times so the example here highly telligent credibly advanced xxunk come to the planet xxmaj earth choose a man to be a great leader on earth they xxunk him to be charge of the whole planet on top of this they give him super powers perhaps somethg like the ability to fly credible strength beg immune from any type of weapons that are available on earth so we see kd of aga a fantasy that really stretches thgs now this fantasy this fantasy beg satisfied but the person beg made to be a leader of the world this man now can address his other fantasies right so this one kd of sets thgs off it starts thgs he gas these superpowers his power general now he can live out all of his fantasies on the planet so i thk this addresses the sense of beg special unique we see narcissism if people on earth refused to recognize how credible the man is perhaps an advanced super telligent alien race will recognize him everybody on earth will have to acknowledge how they were xxunk so we kd of see familiar themes this fantasy right so people that rejected the dividual will now be forced to accept him movg to fantasy number 8 this is a romantic fantasy we see this narcissism borderle histrionic we rarely see this psychopathy the research would assure this is sometimes referred to as the hysterical fantasy the examples usually feature a narcissistic woman who has the fantasy which is kd of terestg because you would thk would be more tied to histrionic xxmaj personality xxmaj disorder but aga it 's featured mostly around narcissism the example here a woman believes that one particular man who she has not met yet will fd her see value her that no one else could see who loved her more than anyone could ever love her this love will go on for a long time hundreds of years or even forever right as a fantasy so anythg 's possible this romantic partner will save her defend her protect her even heal any types of difficulties that she has whether they 're related to mental health or bad memories or trauma of course medical problems could be addressed as well so this dividual is really a xxunk to the woman now many times when i 've seen this fantasy there 's actually been a specific man the fantasy so the woman has a person md she believes that person will recognize her aga do all these different thgs protect her save her so movg now to the nth fantasy this is domation we see variations of scenarios where a man has control over one woman or a group of women this is most closely associated psychopathy narcissism this is kd of terestg because the degree to which those two traits are pronounced really seems to determe the type of fantasy we see this context of domation so i 'll provide an example from the narcissistic side from the psychopathic side so lookg at narcissism a narcissistic man xxunk about women who live an apartment complex he owns so he 's the only male there this apartment complex could hold potentially hundreds of other people aga other than him they would all be women now the narcissistic fantasy the women are there of their own free will because they all love the narcissist they want to be him of course the narcissist wants that love so essentially this fantasy the women are all competg to be this one man so this example he 's not really usg force he 's not really domatg a traditional sense but he is a domant position right they all want to be them this fantasy aga there 's no competition from other men so as we move over to the psychopathic side of this there 's some similarities but also some market differences so we see the same apartment complex the same math right we see one psychopathic man a bunch of women except the psychopathic fantasy the women are prisoners so the psychopath domates them he can do what he wants his fantasy of course he often would now the more psychopathy we see the more this can get to the area of somethg like murder so it 's some psychopathy here we see maybe some xxunk but more psychopathy it gets even darker aga up to an cludg murder it extreme psychopathy it would really just be about murder right there would n't be any sexual relationships or anythg like that it would simply just move right to murder so really when we look at narcissism psychopathy we have to look at the levels of each one aga that kd of determes which way this fantasy can go i 've also seen versions of this fantasy where the dividual the fantasy kd of starts out beg loved like the women are chasg the man but some of the women the man is more aggressive right it 's not where they 're really chasg him he 's chasg them so the fantasy both of those types of approach avoidance are occurrg so the psychopathic xxmaj tennessee can domate sometimes the narcissistic xxmaj tennessee can domate sometimes that can move back forth the same dividual aga as expressed by the fantasies the changes the fantasies now this fantasy of course does n't have to volve an apartment complex i 've seen examples were volved an entire country where the man was the only male an entire country the whole country is full of women i 've seen it were volves a mansion a motel a town a xxmaj space xxmaj station another planet so i can entire planet other than xxmaj earth i 've seen it were volves an entire xxunk so aga there really no balance at all on fantasy we see these fantasies go to credible extremes of course this particular fantasy is especially dark as compared to a lot of these other fantasies now movg to the last fantasy number 10 this is a fantasy of sufferg so we mostly see this narcissism borderle it 's an unusual fantasy the goal seems to be to get attention so the example here a woman has sustaed staggerg losses of family members when she was the only survivor a horrific xxunk accent this causes her to jaw sympathy from people around the world right so notice the sufferg here is really the loss of other people the woman 's not necessarily sufferg physically like she was n't necessarily jured the accident so this suggests a possibility that she 's actually callous right that those losses do n't mean anythg to her this of course would be more common if the narcissistic tendency here the borderle xxmaj tennessee also had psychopathy so we can see how this fantasy becomes darker as more psychopathy enters to the equation i 've also seen examples this where the woman was hurt where she did mourn the loss of the family members right so it does n't have to be callous it does n't have to be psychopathic that 's just a possibility this fantasy also seems to have some overlap xxunk disorder right there 's this idea that the person will voluntarily suffer even hurt themselves order to attract sympathy attention so there are some different fantasies some examples i covered the 10 personality xxunk very quickly then took the more detailed look at cluster personality pathology those 10 examples aga some of them quite disturbg i 've even seen many actually that are more disturbg than what i 've talked about here aga fantasies do n't have any limits so somebody can start out a fantasy that 's a little worrisome that fantasy can develop grow over time that 's somethg that counselors we need to be on the lookout for when fantasy start out kd of mild or playful we 're kd of normal range then start to become distorted dark over time it 's important to be on the lookout for creasg levels of aggression violence themes like revenge domation so we know whenever i talk about topics like fantasy personality pathology there will be a variety of opions please put any opions thoughts the comments section they always generate an terestg dialogue as always i hope you found my analysis of this topic to be terestg thanks for watchg,xxbos i always felt like the difference between the xxmaj united xxmaj states the xxmaj russian space programs could be xxunk up by the toilet because it was dicative of what a lot of the differences were i 'm xxmaj mike xxmaj xxunk this is how hygiene is different space [ ] hygiene space is very important you 're gon na have to do the same sort of thgs that you do want earth like xxunk your teeth keepg yourself clean usg the bathroom all of these thgs are very important very different because you 're dog them space so they do require some trag you want to do it correctly because if you do n't it could lead to trouble on earth we deal flush xxunk if that 's available hopefully to you you do what you need to do then you clean yourself up then it 's on to the xxunk of your day but space it 's different the flights that i had space were on the space show on the space shuttle we had a xxunk it was called the xxup xxunk the waste contament system i thk that was primarily because if he had a problem you did n't want to call xxunk we have a problem we xxunk up the toilet it did n't have a lot of privacy but it had some it had a privacy curta the xxup xxunk had a xxunk for ure for you to urate to a xxunk more or less for you to xxunk to we want to use the word xxunk what do you want to xxunk okay we 're not gon na offend then he went around a planet here okay takg a pee on the xxmaj space xxmaj shuttle was was pretty pretty quick easy the holes came an attachment that you would put on which was a xxunk so everyone had their own we did n't share xxunk it was a little xxunk you 'd open up the xxunk there would be the seven xxunk you would take the appropriate one attach it to the ure collection xxunk then you would turn the system off what it does is it creates a little xxunk so that it 'll take the liquid down the xxunk to the tank when that tank reached a level that it was full we would do a ure dump out to space it would kd of xxunk disappear more or less the vacuum of space so it was okay to dump to dump ure out there if the xxmaj sun was shg who was shg through the dumped ure beauty kd of like a rabow effect that was kd of cool when you were fished you would then turn off the system you would remove your xxunk you would clean it you would put it back its appropriate space then you would clean up a little bit the quickest way to do that was just a wet wipe we had h sanitizer you could use some of that cause you do n't want to spread any germs or anythg like that you want to be very cautious after you get a little experience you could do other thgs like xxunk upside down this was a challenge given to me by a more experienced xxunk who said it is possible to pee upside down you should try it you can you just flip yourself upside down i need to be a little more careful you do n't want to do that on day one you know you do n't want a hot dog it too much but it is possible to pee upside down which is kd of cool i 've done that as well people on the space station is a little bit different than what we had on the space shuttle you still pee to a xxunk but unlike these dividual xxunk it 's a big yellow xxunk one size fits all but on the space station they xxunk the ure along xxunk sweat xxunk all that water is collected then it is cleaned it is treated it is reused so as my friend xxmaj don xxmaj xxunk says today 's coffee is tomorrow 's coffee xxunk space was very volved because you really do n't want to mess this up this is our xxunk xxunk right here i 'll show you but you see it 's pretty small so you have to have pretty good aim the key to this the way it was explaed to us i agree the key to this is alignment next to our real shuttle toilet the xxunk we had a practice toilet that was not for xxunk it was made for alignment practice this is actually one of xxup nasa 's xxunk darkest secrets that we 're gog over here this camera poted up at you when you sat on this you had a call xxunk xxup tv right here so you would see on the camera whether or not you were aligned the target area you would sit on there like you went on maybe on it like you thk you 're on a regular on a regular toilet here then you check you 're alive like xxunk i 'm go we 're near where i want to be on this when you get yourself perfectly aligned the idea was to then try to xxunk what that body position was so on the front of this thg there were like little platform to put your feet underneath okay as you 're sittg on this thg but you can still you but could still come off the back of it that 's not good so order to keep you but on the toilet seat we had these two little arms that would press you to the seat actually to help myself get the right position as i put my arms up like this like i was ridg a xxunk i thought of xxmaj peter xxmaj xxunk a movie called xxmaj easy xxmaj xxunk that was n't good alignment for me after you take care of busess we had a couple thgs to watch out for we had a mirror that we would be traed to then take from there was xxunk to the wall we would take this mirror then put it behd us so as we got off the toilet we saw if anythg was followg us if you get that what i mean okay if there was somethg followg you you would sit back down do whatever you thk was necessary to make sure whatever was followg you off the seat remaed where am i supposed to do you do a little shake if you need to then if thgs get really out of control we have disfectant xxunk just to make sure we clean up here the numberone stuff can sort of go all over the place if you do n't aim correctly the xxunk remaed the toilet we led all of our xxunk then the toilet was serviced once we got on the ground on occasion people had xxunk up the procedure therefore broken the toilet that 's really bad if you break the toilet you ca n't xxunk the toilet on a space shuttle the backup to that was what we called xxmaj xxunk bags that had xxunk that you would tape to your xxunk that 's the way they xxunk xxmaj xxunk they did not have a regular toilet to use that seemed extremely unpleasant right so we did not want to get to the xxmaj xxunk bags so that was kd of like enough to scare you you would make sure you did the procedure correctly on earth cleanless is very important what most of us do is we 'll take a shower every day brush your teeth very important to brush your teeth brush your hair we need to shave but space it 's a little different water is somewhat of a resource particularly on the space station so we want to xxunk what we have a big shower would use these those lots of water so we really ca n't afford to do that so what we did space what the xxunk still do space is you take more of a sponge bath where you have one xxunk that you would put a little water on then you could put some soap to it then soap yourself off this is our body wash so there 's soap side of here we would fill this just like a drk bag as a valve at the top we can squeeze the liquid soap out of it after we added water to it then you would hang all of those thgs up to dry the ventilation system the xxunk of air will allow it to dry space space is a problem so the xxunk we use were packed very tightly on the space station now they have ones they look like almost like a xxunk xxunk xxup nasa autumn there the wash clothes are kd of cool but you want to pack them as tightly as you can the xxunk we have these big xxunk xxunk you can get on earth that 's that happeng space they 're generally thner xxunk but pretty xxunk so they work really well the use of water is so important for our life havg clean water a lot of places do n't have clean water source right so we have this problem space where we need to have water to live for drkg for hygiene for preparg food because a lot of our food items are xxunk so you add a little bit of water to those so we 've done a good job of learng how to effectively xxunk water be able to clean ure water we use for different thgs so that it 's xxunk aga so that is the type of technology that can be very useful parts of the world where gettg clean water is an issue washg our hair usually requires a lot of water on earth but space we use xxunk less xxunk the xxmaj xxunk is right there it 's got xxunk on it if i wanted to put it down i could stick it to the wall it 's got a piece of xxmaj xxunk tape on the top so it wo n't leak xxmaj xxunk tape is space approved tape so what i did was add a little bit of water to a wash cloth then xxunk xxunk then get a good xxunk gog then aga take a towel just dry off my hair the xxunk it worked great because you did n't have to xxunk her hair that way you generally used your own xxunk towel that was somewhat of a personal item yeah xxunk the way i shave on earth i use xxunk cream a a xxunk on the sk that requires runng water you can do that space they do have a special xxunk cream you can use they call it xxunk edge you can also use a xxunk but then you 've got to do somethg the cream the xxunk that are comg off what i xxunk for was an electric xxunk the xxunk were contaed the unit itself then you would clean it if you needed to very carefully a vacuum we generally get a haircut pretty close at a time that we 're gon na fly space on the space station you 're up there for six months so you need to be concerned about a haircut so for that to have an electric xxmaj xxunk aga that 's attached directly to a xxunk so that as you create hair it 'll get sucked right to the vacuum stuff like dead sk cuttg your fgernails or xxunk you want to do that stuff near the vent so that it gets captured by the vent then you can clean it off this was a xxunk that i took me to space xxup nasa could provide you the stard xxunk xxunk but if you provided one of your own they would pack it for you fly it you could use that space if he had a favorite xxunk so i saw this as an opportunity to do somethg fun so i went out purchased this xxunk xxunk to have space xxup nasa then converted it to a space xxunk by puttg a piece of xxunk on it space you brush your teeth the same way more or less you used xxunk toothpaste then you xxunk your mouth but then the question is what do you do that stuff there are two options you can either be a xxunk or a xxunk if you 're a xxunk i felt that was a little more complicated because you have to you know sp to a xxunk deal it so what i do is i just swallow the toothpaste space sounds glamorous does n't it i wear contact xxunk even xxunk my contact xxunk some guys did n't want to do that but i always warm i figured you know as long as i was n't messg my eyes i 'd be ok there was a concern though the xxunk about us havg clean hs when we put the contacts so he had xxunk i guess you can use on earth as well if you were concerned i did not lose a contact space i felt very fortunate that the xxunk to do laundry on earth is fairly straightforward then we have maches that help us but space it 's different because we do n't have a lot of water space it is hard to wash clothes on the space shuttle we had a different shirt everyday we had a different pair of xxunk every day we had pants shorts that would be worn for a few days so we did n't do laundry we just packed that stuff up once we wore the shirt we put it a kd of a clothg b but it was like a big bag then that stuff would be returned to xxmaj earth cleaned returned to us clean on the space station they kd of rely on the supply ships to brg them the new clothes the dirty laundry will get packaged put to a supply ship has been xxunk of supplies now becomes a dumpster that stuff will burn up under the entry it does however on occasion get xxunk space what you smell space the cab is generally each other when we led on the shuttle after this situation for a few weeks the people that would open up the hatch would get a xxunk of this be like was usually the reaction the more experienced recovery technicians would know that ahead of time be prepared for you go to your xxunk to xxunk that becomes your dividual xxunk it does not come its own toilet the rule was on xxunk days the two people gog out to xxunk have first xxunk on the toilet you want it take care of that as best you can before you go out then you put your xxunk on to make it xxunk proof some nice person who packs our stuff writes front on the xxunk so we do n't put it on backwards then we put our fancy xxunk xxunk on then we start gettg dressed the rest of the space you know once you 're locked side of there you have no access to the toilet any longer so if you 're gon na go you 're gon na do it the the xxunk you 're really discouraged from xxunk that thg because you really do n't want that stuff gettg loose there the xxunk should work but why take the risk when we were launchg on the space shuttle we were gog to be puttg a xxunk on as well when we got dressed so you 'd want to use the bathroom at crew quarters then you put on your xxunk a xxunk you go out to the launch xxunk now on the launch xxunk itself there is a toilet we call it the last toilet on earth because you use it then you go to space the last thg you do before you go flyg or go to a xxunk where you 're gon na be stuck is you go to the bathroom it 's part of the checklist we do have a xxunk control so you try to keep yourself cool while you 're xxunk so you do n't sweat xxunk but still you 're gon na be movg around you 're gon na be xxunk a bit one thg you learn aviation as you go to different xxunk thgs are gog to exp meang your stomach i remember the the who was a xxmaj navy guy that was trag us this he said your social xxunk go out the wdow when you 're get side of the airplane you know you might have some extra gas so he said you do n't worry about that you because you do n't want to get a xxunk so the same thg is your xxunk but if you break wd side of your xxunk you 're the only guy that 's gog to be smellg it you wo n't smell it i thk for the future hygiene of course is gon na be important on the xxunk it was a shortterm issue you know you could conta all the xxunk for a couple weeks on the space station now they have a better plan because you 're up there longer periods of time but still the proximity to the earth gives you some advantages you can get xxunk of clothg you can get xxunk of water you can get xxunk of a lot of the thgs you need because we 're low xxmaj earth orbit once we start movg further away from the planet it 's gog to be harder to do that xxunk it 's not gog to be as easy as it is now so i thk we are gog to need a way to wash clothes when we go further away from our planet we 're gog to need a way to do that that does n't require a lot of water also we 're able to conta a lot of the the germs of bacteria we try to go to space very healthy you have a quarante period ahead of time so you do n't have that we have just about every medice xxunk available to us hygiene wise but eventually as we get further further away that may be more of an issue as well of contag some of the xxunk bacteria if you 're very far away from xxmaj earth you 're gog to have to solve that problem on your own so i thk dealg germs cleanless xxunk are gon na be a bigger issue as we go forward where you 're gon na need to take all your toothpaste you or figure out a way to make it or somethg so we 've got to thk about these issues as you move forward [ ] you,xxbos xxmaj transcriber : xxmaj xxunk xxmaj tan \n",

helpful please like it subscribe to my channel well this is dr . raun day today 's question asks if i can discuss the case of xxmaj sarah xxmaj marie xxmaj johnson she was an dividual who was convicted of a double parasite which is an extremely rare type of murder so she was a real person so it 's important i dicate here that i 'm not diagnosg her but rather just speculatg on what could have been gog on a situation like this so first i 'm gog to go through the timele this case then look at some of the mental health personality human behavior aspects after that i 'm gog to take a look briefly at the concept of juvenile parasite aga a rare type of crime fairly terestg so this case starts really three people so other people were volved but it mostly volves three people xxmaj sarah xxmaj marie xxmaj johnson who at the time 2003 was 16 years old her father an xxmaj johnson who 's 6 years old xxmaj diane xxmaj johnson who is 52 years old they lived ellevue xxmaj xxunk they had been married for 20 years so we see the case really starts early on xxmaj september 2nd 2003 we see that xxmaj sarah xxmaj johnson runs out of her home screamg for help she runs over to a neighbor 's house she says that her parents have just been murdered when the police arrived they found xxmaj diane xxmaj johnson xxmaj sarah xxmaj johnson 's mother lyg under the covers her bed she was deceased most of her head was missg they also found an xxmaj johnson lyg next to the bed apparently dead from a gunshot wound to the chest it appears that an stepped out of the shower because he was still wet so he stepped out of the shower he was shot then managed to walk to the bedroom where he collapsed now a trash can outside the xxmaj johnson 's home the police recovered a pk xxunk two gloves a righthed xxunk glove a lefthed leather glove now side the house they also found a great deal of evidence cludg biological material blood xxunk tissue bone fragments that went from the xxmaj johnson 's bedroom to the hallway across to xxmaj sarah xxmaj johnson 's bedroom so xxmaj sarah xxmaj johnson 's bedroom was across from her parents bedroom they also recovered a weapon at the scene a 26 xxunk magnum rifle which is a rifle that has quite a bit of recoil this place apart later on the trial this was found the master bedroom the police also recovered two butcher knives the tips of these knives were touchg they were placed at the end of the xxmaj johnsons bed there was no evidence of forced entry to the house but the house was never locked anyway so that really did n't contribute much to the vestigation when xxmaj sarah first talked to the police she gave several different stories five different accounts actually now one of the key s consistencies here was that she said that her room was closed her bedroom door was closed but they found biological evidence that it was not meang they found xxup dna blood splatter bone tissue her room from the homicide so it turns out her door must have been opened now this is just one consistency but several were discovered her story she admitted that the pk robe belonged to her but she denied knowg how it ended up the trash can when the police first asked about the rug the way xxmaj sarah responded was that she did not kill her parents the police found this to be kd of an terestg way to approach that question so they found it odd now this is an terestg piece here because i fd that police often do this these type of cases they look at the human behavior side they say well it does n't really fit based on what was gog on so her behavior may have been odd but if her parents were just murdered she was n't the perpetrator then it 's hard to know how somebody should react people react to stress a lot of different ways but of course this was used agast her the trial later on now the rifle i mentioned just a moment ago that was used to kill the xxmaj johnsons belonged to somebody that they rented a garage apartment to his name was xxmaj mel xxmaj xxunk he had an alibi he was away from that area durg the time of the murders he did dicate how that it was his rifle he kept it unlocked his apartment xxmaj sarah xxmaj johnson had access to that apartment when the police terviewed the friends neighbors they tend to thk that xxmaj sarah xxmaj johnson was fatuated a 1 year old boyfriend named runo xxmaj santos so runo xxmaj santos became kd of key suspect early on these two had been datg for about three months before the murder of the xxmaj johnsons they did not approve of him for a variety of reasons on xxmaj august 2th which was just a few days before the murders xxmaj sara told her parents she 'd be spendg a night friends but stead she spent the night runo xxmaj santos when her parents found out her father went to look for the next day confronted xxmaj santos brought her home she was grounded from that pot on now later on accordg to a witness testimony we found out that xxmaj sarah seemed to take this punishment pretty well unusually well usually she 'd be upset when somethg like this happened she did n't seem to be upset so later on when the police had an opportunity to analyze the evidence there was xxup dna testg other testg done that connected a robe to xxmaj sara xxmaj johnson the gloves to xxmaj sara xxmaj johnson later on they would also fd a shower cap that had been xxunk down the toilet after this xxmaj sara xxmaj johnson was charged firstdegree murder durg her trial there was a lot of testimony about xxmaj sarah xxmaj johnson 's appropriate behavior how she tended to not have emotions that people thought fit the situation she seemed to be more concerned her boyfriend she also did n't appear to be traumatized at her parents funeral she talked about how she wanted to play xxunk that night some other people also said that her sadness seemed to be superficial i thk this is important because there 's a few aspects here that a mental health professional might be able to detect but a member of the general public might not be able to but yet of course it 's still admissible court for example if she did not seem traumatized well what does somebody who 's traumatized seem like what does that look like also what is superficial sadness how did we defe that how would we know when somebody 's beg sad but it 's only really at the surface so aga kd of how people appear after events like this this is used agast them even if the person evaluatg that behavior is not really qualified to comment on the nuances that behavior they 're not really qualified to assess the person so i thk of course as i 'll talk about later on i thk she was guilty of these crimes but it 's terestg how these pieces kd of come together people look at somebody they say oh they do n't seem to be traumatized or they seemed to have superficial feelgs aga that 's used testimony a similar way we see that her brother testified agast her described her as dramatic a good actress somebody who lied a lot so there 's a lot of people testifyg agast xxmaj sarah xxmaj johnson based on her behavior so now terms of the defense i 've talked about what the prosecution had to say terms of the defense they noted that there was a lack of blood or tissue found on xxmaj sarah or her clothg they did n't fd anythg her hair or her hs or really anywhere now the mother xxmaj diane was shot at close range so really it would be impossible that the murderer would n't have been xxunk blood so this became kd of a key part of the case for the defense there were no fgerprts found on the xxunk on the rifle or those knives that were arranged i talked about but there was testimony from one of xxmaj sarah xxmaj johnson 's cellmates usually i thk of this type of testimony as extremely unreliable it was admitted probably did n't help her case of course she was found guilty on two counts of murder the first degree she was sentenced to two life terms she will not have the possibility of parole at this pot she 's out of xxmaj appeals there were several appeals that took place she was unsuccessful so that 's the timele this case this is an extremely terestg case xxmaj sarah xxmaj johnson really almost got away these murders but they were poorly planned for example there was a garbage truck that would have picked up the trash where that evidence was there was one house away when the police arrived so she almost did get away this parasite now we see that terms of some of the case characteristics or terestg runo xxmaj santos seemed like somebody the police should really vestigate it was a confrontation between him the dad a few days before i mentioned that the police found him to be arrogant he had a weak alibi he had been the house before he refused to stop seeg xxmaj sara xxmaj johnson even though the parents told him to stop so he aga seemed like a good cidate to consider for this murder but when they vestigated him they found no evidence that he was volved so then the case kd of turned toward xxmaj sara xxmaj johnson there was quite a bit of evidence that tied her to these murders now i 've already talked about the physical evidence that was the robe the gloves that are connected to her there was some bruisg on her shoulder from the recoil of the rifle she tried to expla it away but it was lear the way it was on her shoulder it did look like it came from the rifle but terms of behavioral evidence this became kd of a key part her case it makes her case kd of terestg her consistencies terms of when she was terviewed by the police itially none of this looked good this did n't go her favor so terms of the mental health personality human behavior perspective aga just speculatg on what could have been gog on a situation like this we see that this type of case where you have a young female perpetrator committg a double parasite is exceedgly rare parasites are rare already when a male commits them a female committg a parasite particularly a juvenile female this is somethg we just do n't see the mental health professionals at testify at trial i 'll get to their testimony a mute they said that she did have clical depression a suicide attempt but no history of violence were crime so aga double parasite just does n't seem to fit this case now i mentioned the parasites are exceedgly rare about two to four percent of all homicides xxmaj western countries are parasites about two percent of homicides the xxmaj united xxmaj states are parasites nety percent of the perpetrators are male when somebody kills both their father their mother a situation like that it 's almost always a male so a parasite all female is very rare especially a double parasite if we look at about the last 25 years or so there are fewer than five cases like this the xxmaj united xxmaj states that i could fd all of them volved abuse aga xxmaj sarah xxmaj johnson did n't appear to be abused so there 's been a lot of fascation terest this case because it 's unusual it may actually be really the only case of its type aga the last 25 years or maybe even more the xxmaj united xxmaj states so now takg a closer look at the mental health piece to mental health professionals testified durg the trial really at the sentencg phase they really were talkg about the hope that xxmaj sarah xxmaj johnson could be rehabilitated really they said similar thgs right so the first clician said that xxmaj sarah xxmaj johnson had clical depression for the two years xxunk the murders but showed no evidence of psychosis conduct disorder or antisocial personality evidence of conduct disorder before the age of 15 is required for a diagnosis of antisocial personality but aga no evidence was available that supported either of those diagnoses she did not appear to be prone to violence she was described as beg fairly normal now this clician said that she was amenable to rehabilitation thought it was very likely that if she was released some day she would never commit another crime like this now the next mental health professional testified really found the same thg except he appeared to have even a more positive image of the chances of rehabilitation he dicated she had a high potential for successful rehabilitation lookg at her mental health history her personality characteristics he concluded there would be a substantial likelihood that she could be reformed completely not pose any danger to society now terestgly what he really added to this discussion was that she did n't need to accept responsibility at this pot order to be rehabilitated so i guess he was kd of thkg that she was n't confessg to the crimes at that pot at sentencg but maybe she would lay then that could facilitate her rehabilitation later on so throughout this whole process to the trial even up till now as far as i know she 's never accepted responsibility for these crimes she still says that she 's not guilty so weighg this testimony the court concluded that rehabilitation her case was possible but there 's certa conduct that crosses a le somebody represents too much of a danger to society so she was aga sentenced to life prison out the possibility of parole we see her attempts to appeal that the ma argument was that sentencg a child to die prison constitutes cruel unusual punishment many states have banned this practice other states are very careful about life sentences for mors but either way the court stayed the origal fdg she 's prison for life so what happened the case of xxmaj sarah xxmaj johnson aga this is such an unusual case what motivated her to commit these crimes what caused this well she was careful her planng so of course it did appear premeditated but it also appeared to be driven by kd of an immature emotional reaction the whole boyfriend thg that she was tryg to move forward she wanted to see the boyfriend her parents would let her it 's hardly a reason to commit a heous murder now it sts to reason that impulsivity may have played a part these murders positive urgency this is n't somebody has positive emotions they ca n't resist the impulse to act on them also negative urgency because she did n't get along her parents so that could have contributed i thk there was xxup xxunk a degree of fantasy which is n't unusual people that are narcissistic so it may have been that she had some narcissistic tendencies i thk she had fantasies potentially about money the xxunk money as well as of course a life the boyfriend now it was brought up at trial that she watched a lot of true crime xxup tv that 's where maybe she got the idea of how to use the robe the gloves tried to make it look like she was n't guilty now that does n't necessarily speak to why she did it but it 's terestg that maybe she kd of learned some of those tactics from television now aga we 've never seen a confession this case so really kd of left out knowg what really happened we have little sight to our state of md we 're just left to speculate based on this restricted amount of evidence so the last part i 'll cover here is parasite i 'll talk about parasite some of its characteristics aga i mentioned this was a double parasite committed by a juvenile female extremely rare event we see the juvenile parasite is an extremely low base rate behavior to start most of the time when we see juvenile parasite it 's because of abuse or is connected to abuse some way meang a child was abused then they acted out so they feel trapped they feel like they ca n't get out of the situation they have no other way to go so they end up committg a murder about 25 percent of time they will use an xxunk much of the time juvenile parasite offenders have little or no histories terms of juvenile delquency or violent behavior we also see they 're not usually volved mental health treatment although some have had personality disorders juvenile xxunk offenders tend to kill xxunk situations so they killed a parent while the parents back is turned or while they 're sleepg or on a computer or somethg like that so this case we kd of see this does connect to what happened we see the xxmaj sara xxmaj johnson shot her mother her mother was asleep at the time then went toward the bathroom entered the bathroom shot her father so we do n't know if maybe she was tryg to kill both of them really quickly out anybody knowg out havg to have some sort of confrontation but when she walked the room i 'm sure she could hear that the showers runng so she must have known that she was gog to kill the mother then have to confront the father so that was kd of another unusual part of this case of course this case has a lot of unusual features this idea that she confronted the father he was stg up awake alert when he was shot now we solved the trial to his speculation that she must have xxunk the father some way there was this idea that there must have been some sort of short disguise that occurred if she said somethg to him or she heard somethg from him but we do n't really know she could have shot the mother operated a xxunk rifle then shot the father just that quickly so we do n't really know if any communication occurred aga she did n't reveal any formation about that now because of this element of this type of crime shootg somebody when they 're not lookg or they 're sleepg xxunk is a hard argument for juvenile xxunk offenders to make of course we see xxmaj sarah xxmaj johnson she goes through this elaborate process to make it look like somebody else committed the crime we also see parasites a lot of times a battered child syndrome is used as a defense but aga xxmaj sarah xxmaj johnson was n't abused so that could n't be used either so terms of as a mental health community what can we do about juvenile parasite parasite general double parasite unfortunately there is n't much we can do juvenile parasite particular is essentially impossible to predict as are a lot of parasites there is no way to predict somethg that has such a low base rate especially because there 's a little history of delquent behavior or violence so it 's tough to get front of these types of cases prevent them we just do n't know when they 're gon na happen or who 's gon na xxunk them on top of this there are no risk assessment xxunk that are currently available that can help us to predict juvenile parasite either so we really have no tools to work terms of preventg this type of crime obviously if somebody 's workg a client they say they 're gon na do this or there 's some clear evidence a counselor can act on that but outside of that we do n't really get a lot of warng these types of cases so this is a very terestg case as i mentioned this is really one of the most rare types of murders that we see really anywhere i do n't thk this case really received a lot of attention but it is pretty terestg i thk if xxmaj sarah xxmaj johnson had confessed told her story that would have attracted a little bit more attention because we could have really received more formation about maybe what she was thkg but she did n't so aga we 're kd of cut off we do n't have a lot of formation the case does n't really generate a lot of terest now so i know whenever i talk about these types of cases like xxunk committg parasite cases like this there 's gog to be different opions if you agree or disagree me or have other opions please put those the comments that always generates a really terestg dialogue as always i hope you found this description of the xxmaj sarah xxmaj johnson murder case to be terestg thanks for watchg,xxbos welcome to my scientifically formed sider look at mental health topics if you fd this video to be terestg or helpful please like it subscribe to my channel hello this is dr . gre today 's question asks i can analyze the mental health personality characteristics at work the xxmaj darlie routier case another question here is what do i thk terms of her guilt or nocence so the people this case of course are real people so just a remder i 'm not diagnosg anybody only speculatg about what could be happeng a situation like this so first i 'll take a look at the timele then the evidence the vestigation i 'll look at the trial as well the mental health personality characteristics answer that question about guilt nocence so we start the timele xxmaj thursday xxmaj june 6th 16 xxmaj xxunk xxmaj texas this is a town that 's 25 miles north of xxmaj dallas xxmaj texas we see it 's xxunk a.m. 26 yearold xxmaj darlie routier calls 11 reports that an truder broke to her house attacked her her two sons her husb xxmaj aaron 28 a third son ke who was 7 months old were asleep upstairs the house the police arrived just mutes later as they were xxunk the house they noticed that the wdows screen the garage had been cut they failed to fd any truder so they permitted the paramedics to enter xxmaj darlie son xxmaj devon aged 6 was found dead her son xxmaj damon aged 5 would die before reachg the hospital xxmaj darlie told the police that she decided to sleep downstairs so she could watch xxup tv she had been sleepg downstairs on off over the last several weeks because the baby 's crib was the master bedroom the baby will grow up when he moved she was asleep the family room xxmaj devon xxmaj damon when she felt a nudge on her shoulder heard xxmaj damon xxunk talkg she opened her eyes saw a stranger wearg dark clothg a baseball cap stg over her of course this is her report about what happened xxmaj darlie said she walked after the assailant heard glass breakg as he fled she got halfway through the kitchen then she went back to turn on a light as she ran back toward the utility room you saw a xxunk knife on the floor this is when she realized that she was covered blood xxmaj darlie reached down picked up the knife as the truder made his exit through a door the garage xxmaj darlie dropped the knife yelled upstairs to wake up xxmaj dar her husb this is when she xxunk 11 this call to 11 lasted five mutes seconds four mutes five seconds to the call xxmaj darlie dicated that there was a knife the operator said there 's a knife do n't touch anythg xxmaj darlie responded i already touched it picked it up five mutes four seconds to the call xxmaj darlie says the knife was lyg over there i already picked it up the operator says it 's all right xxmaj darlie responds by sayg i bet we could have gotten the prts may be referrg to prts on the knife the statement would be used agast her later on at trial at 3:0 a.m. xxmaj darlie went to surgery so by some accounts her wounds were severe specifically the wound on her neck was only two millimeters away from her xxunk artery the surgeons also had to remove part of a necklace that had been pushed to the wound on her neck other cuts were on her arms as well other accounts though say that all the wounds were superficial so we see disagreement about how severely she was wounded now movg to the vestigation the trial at 6:00 11:00 a.m. detectives from the xxmaj xxunk xxmaj police xxmaj department terviewed xxmaj darlie she could not offer a description of the xxunk face around the same time we see that a socalled crime scene consultant named xxmaj james cron arrived at darlie 's house he stated that 20 to 30 mutes after he arrived he had determed that there had been no truder this shaped the vestigation gog forward it really ruled out the possibility of fdg a suspect other than xxmaj darlie or xxmaj dar this remds me of a short story by xxmaj edgar len xxmaj poe named the murders the room work there 's this particular sentence from this story that i thk connects over what happened here so i 'll read the sense this idea however simple it may now seem escaped the police for the same reason that the breadth of the xxunk had escaped them because by the affair of the nails their perceptions had been hermetically sealed agast the possibility of the wdows have ever been opened at all of course we see there that poses wdows have ever stead of wdows havg ever but that was written a long time ago but either way that story we see that what xxunk really sayg is the possibility was ruled out by the police aga their mds hermetically sealed so nothg was gettg terrupt aga we see that here this case the vestigation really got off to a bad start it was extremely limited from the begng now movg to xxmaj june 18 we see that xxmaj darlie was arrested evidently the police were xxunk celebratg as she was arrested so kd of xxunk to see that reaction we see she was dicted by a gr jury on xxmaj june 28th now there was a change venue this trial because of the media coverage the trial opened on xxmaj january 6 17 so really the trial started pretty quickly considerg when the arrest was especially considerg this was a capital murder case the prosecutor presented his theory that xxmaj darlie was suicidal suffered from depression she must have killed her boys an effort to mata her xxunk lifestyle now we hear these stories about the prosecution tryg to make it seem like the motive was surance money but actually the prosecution did not contend that xxmaj darlie killed for that money we see the closg arguments the prosecution talked about motive not beg required that 's actually true motive was not required the jury could fd xxmaj darlie guilty out knowg a motive or out one beg demonstrated so what i fd terestg about the openg the prosecution here is how they 're kd of weaponizg mental health symptoms so as far as the prosecution is concerned depression just ca n't be somethg that 's common causes sufferg rather it must expla why people commit murder so a real leap there that is quite illogical it shows a real lack of understg of how depression works now terms of specifically the thoughts of suicide that 's a little different if somebody 's at a high risk to commit suicide they could be at a higher risk to harm other people right that 's not usual it happens but that could happen we see a lot of different testimony this trial a physician testified that darlie 's wounds could have been selfflicted police officers testified that xxmaj darlie seemed overly concerned her own wounds did not render aid to her sons which makes me kd of wonder what level of concern would be permitted if somebody is wounded if she had ignored her own wounds they might have labeled her a psychopath also we see that she had bruises on her arms but those appeared later so that kd of worked agast her now we see about that cut wdow that the police determed that the dust around the wdow was xxunk therefore they determed that it would be impossible for anybody to have entered or xxunk through that wdow later we see a demonstration that illustrated one could easily move out of that wdow out disturbg anythg we see a man 's white tube sock was located near a storm dra about 75 yards from the house the sock had blood on it from both xxmaj devon xxmaj damon the prosecution determed that xxmaj darlie must have planted it now this is terestg considerg the testimony we see this trial from the defense we see testimony that established xxmaj damon could not have lived more than ne mutes after his wounds were xxunk now takg to account the amount of time that xxmaj darlie spent on the phone the 11 operator aga about five mutes seconds this only leaves xxmaj darlie just over three mutes to plant the sock get back to the house commit the crimes staged the crime scene xxunk those wounds on herself the prosecution attempted to refute this by sayg that she could have planted the sock beforeh that the medical testimony around that amount of time that xxmaj damon would have lived was not precise now that 11 call of course xxmaj darlie express was concerned about fdg prts on the knife the prosecutor says here that she did this to set up her defense another possible conclusion of course is that she wanted the person who did it to be caught then we have the birthday party this is arguably the most controversial circumstance that was brought up at the trial the funeral for xxmaj devon xxmaj damon was on xxmaj sunday xxmaj june th xxmaj darlie was released from the hospital the day before we see on the xxmaj friday after as xxmaj june 1 the xxmaj xxunk would have turned seven so xxmaj darlie other family members a number of friends had a birthday party at the xxunk now this occurred after a private memorial service at this party there were xxunk toys durg this party we see xxmaj darlie smiled laughed sprayed silly strg now we see the closg arguments that one of the prosecutors kd of makes a big deal about the silly strg tape he says that this tape gives you a lot of sight to this woman durg their xxunk the jury xxunk this clip of the birthday party eight or ne times so clearly they were considerg the content of that video now the lead prosecutor this case was named xxmaj greg xxmaj davis when he saw this recordg this was long before the trial he said how disgusted he was that anybody could act that way now this is an terestg choice of words for him to reveal that he was feelg disgusted disgust is really an emotion of eradication disposal destruction right so if somebody 's disgusted by somethg they want to get rid of it it 's not the same thg as fear now it 's terestg because xxmaj greg xxmaj davis would later be dicted on a felony unrelated to this case xxunk a government record although he was never convicted now other testimony he spoke to perhaps a fancial motive xxmaj charlie 's housekeeper dicated that xxmaj darlie told her that she needed $ 10,000 so maybe there was some money problems gog on that couple fact i thk it was pretty well established that they were n't good shape fancially durg that time now the same housekeeper though also testified that she saw a mysterious black car outside of the house a few days before the murders on one occasion the car was the alley behd the house the driver was starg to the garage other testimony focused more on physical evidence at the crime scene we see there was testimony about the tshirt that xxmaj darlie was wearg it was xxunk back together not all the holes the tshirt led up her wounds specifically there are four holes the shirt that did n't have a xxunk wound makg it look like she took the shirt off caused the wounds then put the shirt back on now if she was tryg to get away these crimes it 's not clear why she would have done this it would have made more sense to the shirt on but either way that was a theory that we saw presented one of the other knives that butcher block the kitchen specifically a bread knife had some glass debris rubber dust on it that matched the material the garage wdow screen that was cut makg it look like xxmaj darlie cut the screen her own knife put it back now there were theories that those fibers were actually from a fgerprtg brush that 's a possibility it was n't really clearly established either way now there was a broken we glass on the floor darlie 's blood was found under the glass now clearly the glass could have been moved by all the first responders gog out of the house so i do n't thk that was particularly powerful evidence we see efforts were made to clean the kitchen sk the countertop front of the sk traces of blood were found on the countertop so that does n't look so good for xxmaj darlie then we see testimony about blood splatter we see an expert testified xxmaj darlie could have been the murder based on how the splatter hit the front of her shirt the back of her shirt the defense poted out that her blood was mixed her son 's blood on that shirt now we see testimony about how the alleged assailant acted a way that no other assailant would act the prosecution said that he would not have cut the screen he would not have killed an anger he would not have left a witness so really they 're sayg the way this crimal operated made no sense well often crimals do n't make a lot of sense right the crimes are irrational regardless of who committed them i thk this is kd of a weak prosecutorial strategy so they 're lookg at this event sayg no one would do this yet somebody did do it they were accusg somebody of dog it or they 're really tryg to say like well a crimal that breaks to houses would n't do this but somehow the mother of sons would do this so aga no matter how they want to frame it they 're sayg that it was an unusual crime so a sense i thk they 're kd of buildg reasonable doubt toward the defendant as well as toward the alleged assailant that the defendant said was there now lookg through the transcript of the trial the defense never brought up the idea that xxmaj darren could have committed the crime now i do n't thk he did but that strategy could have created reasonable doubt right especially because the kd of ruled out every suspect the world except for xxmaj darlie xxmaj darren even still i thought the defense did a good job i thought they presented what seemed like an effective closg potg out that xxmaj james cron sealed darlie 's fate by declarg there was no truder soon after arrivg on the scene i thought that was a very good pot we see general the defense really hammered the xxunk vestigation that occurred either way though xxmaj february 17 xxmaj darlie was convicted of murderg xxmaj damon was sentenced to death she has not been tried the death of xxmaj devon so evidently the jury did feel that the prosecution met its burden now sce beg convicted xxmaj darlie has filed many appeals some are still xxunk we see that xxmaj dar divorced xxmaj darlie 2011 it 's now movg to the mental health personality characteristics so we see here that xxmaj darlie reported she had xxunk depression as well as anxiety evidently she had been depressed at the time of the murders there are some xxunk from a journal that seemed to dicate depression most notably on xxmaj may 3 16 she wrote a suicide note to her children at trial she said it was not significant now if that was the motive right if she wanted to end her own life why did she plant the sock the sock was really xxunk that would have helped her defense she would n't need a defense if she was dead we also see that xxmaj darlie was trustg she went talked to the police out an attorney which of course is always a bad idea there 's no good reason to talk to the police if you 're a suspect an vestigation we see that she did not appear really to be a crimal mastermd right so when lookg at this evidence like the sock beg planted some distance away i do n't know if she really would have thought of that there 's nothg really clear from kd of watchg the videos readg through the transcripts that dicated she was thkg that way like she had that capability also she had no history of violence no history of psychopathy i do n't really see much the way of psychopathy at all some of me the argument that maybe she was narcissistic like she was materialistic arrogant well a lot of people are like that even if she was like that not tied to murder we also see this argument that her grievg was appropriate like the silly strg tape this is one of the thgs that a great xxunk the most about how these cases are vestigated the idea there 's a right way or an appropriate way to grief a highly unusual situation this is the type of circumstance that few people will ever experience two children beg murdered nobody knows how they would react to that even if one could make the argument that her way of grievg was xxunk different than other people that still does n't pot to guilt now movg over to the police the prosecution here we see a lot of terestg factors what really sts out to me is the lack of any type of critical thkg skills or a cognitive reasong ability i thk what happened here is they needed to believe somethg they came right there they needed a belief that xxmaj darlie was guilty there 's also the sense that they 're really kd of lazy the vestigation they did not follow up like they did n't vestigate the story about that suspicious vehicle it 's like if they were to do that they 're reducg their chances of makg sure that xxmaj darlie is found guilty right so their mission is n't to fd xxmaj darlie guilty their mission is to fd the truth i thk sometimes that gets lost when talkg about these types of vestigations we also see this theory that the vestigators were narcissistic so aga just makg a xxunk examation declarg that everythg has been figured out celebratg when xxmaj darlie was arrested right it 's not a happy occasion it 's not a time for high fives a bunch of fun now we see that the vestigators were not proficient at conductg an vestigation so a situation like this i 'd probably say more readg would be helpful more trag less just kd of actg impulsively gog one 's gut i thk there was a lot of confirmation bias occurrg here they locked on to a conclusion then they found the evidence to support that conclusion stead of lettg the evidence guide them to the conclusion we see a lot of flawed thkg this vestigation so like distorted thoughts like everythg that deviates from normal is bad or worse yet everythg that deviates from normal is crimal we see that there was this belief that no one would grab a knife from a victim 's kitchen well ard xxmaj ramirez xxmaj night xxmaj stalker did this several times he committed 13 murders before he was caught right so aga i 'm left the impression that these vestigators did n't spend a lot of time readg about other cases now another thg that strikes me here is perhaps these vestigators were fluenced by the xxmaj susan xxmaj smith case this occurred about a xxunk before we see a young mother xxmaj union xxmaj south xxmaj carola who murdered her two sons of course xxmaj susan xxmaj smith would later confess so perhaps these vestigators really wanted to kd of move thgs ahead they want to get ahead of the curve just jump to the conclusion that xxmaj darlie must have been guilty so it 's possible we saw a lot of illogical reasong here so lookg at this case what about the idea of xxmaj darlie beg guilty or not guilty which one makes more sense well the stard a crimal proceedg xxmaj texas the rest of the xxmaj united xxmaj states is the person has to be guilty beyond a reasonable doubt i thk clearly xxmaj darlie is not guilty beyond a reasonable doubt it 's actually frighteng to me that a jury could come up any other verdict but not guilty this case this stard beyond a reasonable doubt can be quantified roughly as 85 to 0 percent sure so they were about 85 0 percent certa that she was guilty there 's no way that they could have been that certa that really just amazes me now movg over to guilt nocence this is a different concept right so guilty not guilty or concepts on the law guilt or nocence is more like if we could see the perfect truth of somethg the absolute truth was darlg guilty or nocent well all my concerns about this case there are many i have many concerns about what happened here i still thk it 's more likely than not that she 's guilty i would say the probability is somewhere between 55 to % on the side that she 's guilty well below the reasonable stard but still more likely than not so here i 'll look at the factors potg toward guilt the factors potg toward nocence so the factors potg toward guilt we see xxmaj darlie hled the murder weapon right all thgs beg equal this is a bad sign if the suspect hles the murder weapon that does n't look good the murder weapon was not troduced from the outside it was from her kitchen certaly possible but aga it pots more toward guilt she had recently demonstrated a desire to end her own life so that shows a degree of despair that could be consistent murder the alleged assailant left behd no evidence that could identify him the fibers from the screen on the bread knife that looks suspicious why would an assailant come from the outside kill her sons failed to kill her why did she clean the countertop the sk her story changed several times she also claimed not to remember thgs that she had previously remembered there are not many good reasons that her story should have changed if she were nocent so now let 's look at factors potg toward nocence well of course the frighteng level of competence demonstrated by the vestigators we never really got to see if there were any other good suspects right so aga that 's quite disturbg the crime as she described it is consistent an assailant who was tent on assaultg her sexually this would expla why he would have murdered the children left her alive so that particular type of assailant her story does make sense we see really no good explanation for the sock that was found 75 yards away from her house also i fd it hard to believe that she would leave that anybody would fd that sock there 's no evidence here that she had experience forensic vestigation i mean she could 've left that sock there wondered if anybody ever would have found it right but it became kd of a key part of her defense so the sock kd of pots toward nocence this case we see no apparent motive if her motive was to collect the five thous dollars life surance why did n't she target xxmaj dar his policy was worth $ 800,000 if she did have some reason to kill her sons why did n't she kill all three right it 's hard to thk of what reason there would be just to kill two but not to kill all three xxmaj damon was alive when the police arrived right so xxmaj darlie was not a medical expert of any type there 's no reason to believe that she knew how long xxmaj damon would live she did n't know for sure he would die before he reached the hospital why would she take that chance why would he have still been alive when the first responders arrived also this case we see no confession xxmaj darlie has always mataed her nocence so brgg everythg together this was a tragic case that was poorly vestigated there 's so much formation that we should have but we do not have it 's a testament to how easy it is to be convicted of a crime out sufficient evidence how difficult it is to xxunk a conviction that should have never happened this case also highlights a lot of flaws the justice system we see this entry pot for xxmaj darlie to the justice system pretty much for anybody is the police yet the police use a different set of rules then we see the courts there is no reasonable doubt stard police as they vestigate crimes so if the police officer kd of locks on or a detective kd of locks on to a suspect starts aga havg that confirmation bias that leads the suspect gettg the court where yes they have more rights there but beg there puts them jeopardy right so that 's kd of the first domo the police once that domo falls all the other xxunk can fall when lookg at the crimal justice system we see a lot of xxunk professionals like attorneys judges porg over thouss of pages of documents readg references from the law to come up these different theories different opions it does seem to work pretty well but all that work is based on potentially police officers makg a decision a couple seconds aga it 's not based on any critical reasong skills so seems like a lot of the thkg power is kd of expended the courts not enough is expended kd of out the field that early stage of the vestigation my last pot for this conclusion we see that many people correctly assign value to how people react durg times of severe stress i 've seen this a number of cases i reviewed it 's really not somethg that 's logical people are placg a lot of meang somethg that could have absolutely no meang right so of course potentially it has meang but it 's not consistent her reaction could have dicated guilt it could have dicated nocence we have no way of distguishg which one xxmaj italy pots to i know whenever i talk about controversial cases there will be a variety of opions please put any opions thoughts the comment section

kids between six 17 years of age found the middle of all this xxunk about exercise 57 % of our kids are still failg fitness test fitness leaders say they 're worse now than they were thirty years ago we 're fdg 1 to 0 old kids 0 % block at the coronary arteries which used to be called adult onset diabetes not showg up kids between 10 years of age they say we 're raisg the first generation that will have a shorter life expectancy than either their parents or grparents it has never before happened our history the state of xxmaj oregon has the highest rate of obesity of any state west of the xxmaj rockies our public schools are beg gutted because of budget cuts the first thg we always cut is physical education they formed an xxmaj oregon health policy xxmaj commission to tell us how to solve this problem they published a 65 page report which basically said we do n't know what they said this children 's behaviors are substantially affected by the fluential adults their lives parents grparents teachers efforts to address childhood obesity xxmaj oregon will not be successful unless they also clude terventions that fluence the healthy eatg physical activity behaviors of adults as well as children now they xxunk this message down a bit their fal draft but the idea was out how many of you get all the exercise you need if not why not well the two most common xxunk are what do you thk it is number one i do n't have time every time we 've asked i do n't have time number two this surprised me how often they stayed how boldly they stated was i 'm too lazy to do it even when i do have time or the way the way one can head to xxmaj south xxmaj carola said it i swear after college i 'd never sweat aga let 's just call it lack of motivation but every time we the medical fitness field have been bold enough to ask why do n't you do it you 've been credibly honest you 've been credibly consistent you said two thgs xxwrep 4 over aga i do n't have time i do n't know how to stay motivated to exercise you would thk all medical fitness leaders who cared would have scheduled a national convention somewhere got to a big room said let 's just solve these two problems it has never happened as fitness leaders we are not traed to deal i do n't have time i do n't know how to stay motivated to exercise almost changed my major the xxmaj university of xxmaj north xxmaj carola when i heard some guys xxmaj california say exercise that my wife is to take a bath pull the plug fight the current what they teach us to say is ya got ta make exercise fun he ever heard that it 's all over the place make it fun make it folks over the past thirty ne years i 've put over ten thous xxmaj americans on exercise programs i 'm here to tell you i 've learned a lot about exercise one of the thgs i 've learned is if what you 're dog for exercise is fun i guarantee you you 're not dog it right there are physiological requirement that must be met order to benefit from your exercise program whether you like it or not the tensity the duration the frequency of your exercise are all more important than whether or not it 's fun you must work every muscle the body the cardiovascular system flexibility muscle balance muscle strength there 's no sgle activity or exercise that we know of that adequately works your total body if you do n't sit down design a total body workout it is n't gog to happen so how do you solve this problem well i got to meet dr . mark xxmaj angel dr . mark xxmaj angel has a dual professorship at xxmaj middle xxmaj tennessee xxmaj state xxmaj university xxmaj murfreesboro i do a professorship the department of psychology xxmaj health xxmaj human xxmaj performance he wrote an article xxunk a new fitness major he was gog to call applied exercise psychology which would have been what i xxunk had it existed when i was school but basically what he had done is wrote an article to the xxmaj journal of the board of sports psychology explag what he saw was justification for this new fitness major explas the problems he saw physical fitness it almost exactly mirrored what i 've been speakg on for over thirty years to the pot where i wanted to meet this guy so i flew back to xxmaj xxunk drove down to xxmaj murfreesboro looked him up his office went up to him gave a great big bear hug said you 're my hero he called for security know it no that did n't happen but but i explaed them what i was dog he was so appreciative of that i has a new book out promised to send me a new copy which i have n't gotten yet um but but what he basically said is this this fitness problem is more about our mental failures that our physical failures it 's more about your head your attitude than it is about your body he said you just ca n't decide to exercise have a susta you for the rest of your life so your bras gon na fight you you say i want to start an exercise program your bra says what are you dog have n't we been down this road look at you look at your dog but he says you have to w the mental balance it 's tough one guy said he got his car decided to go to the health club he got down to the tersection the light turned red he said that 's a sign turn around went back home but if you can w the mental battle for five consecutive years you will never go back to your previously sedentary lifestyle but you got to keep it up how do you w the psychological battle associated gettg ourselves to exercise well make it just that a lifestyle it become has to become a habit now we know that rather than workg out every day excuse me seven to three days a week the way we 've been taught workg out seven days a week or xxmaj gordon xxmaj american xxmaj college of xxmaj sports xxmaj medice worked out most days or every day i should thank you i 've been sayg that for over thirty years see it 's easy to work out everyday than it is to work out three days a week three days a week gives you too many decisions xxmaj monday xxmaj wednesday xxmaj friday mmhmm xxmaj tuesday xxmaj thursday xxmaj saturday can i skip the day double up tomorrow folks if you 're negotiatg about whether or not to work out it 's over do you work out first thg the morng you have a 300 percent greater chance of gettg it done than at any other time of day because you have more control over your schedule for stay the morng than any other time of day try to xxunk your workout time to 20 mutes or less the more time you spend exercisg the less likely you are to do it then we 're likely you are to get jured we 'll keep you from dog it anyway then work agast resistance if you work agast resistance you get tired faster now the most important rule exercise physiology is called the overload prciple it says no benefit occurs any exercise program until you get tired the problem is as you get more fit what happens to the amount of work you have to do to get tired it goes up the public schools they did xxmaj studies on high school boys asked them to do as many pushups they could every day until they get got tired do that every day for a year the boys you can do five pushups on the first day after year we 're dog between 100 120 to get to the same level of fatigue that five got it on the first day we 're talkg xxunk xxunk even if you do have time so then we say we 'll just go on a diet well folks the quickest way i know to get an xxmaj american fat is to go on a diet do n't ever diet another day the rest of your life eat for nutrition never eat for weight loss never make any change the way you eat that you 're not willg to make permanent now there 's a lot more i want to talk about nutrition but for lack of time let 's just concentrate on on physical fitness today so seven days a week first day the morng fan to spend about 20 mutes or less then work agast resistance so that as you become more fit you do n't spend more time you work agast more resistance so how do you do that well i was speakg to the xxmaj university xxmaj xxunk xxmaj club xxmaj seattle one of the members came up when i was done said i 'm one of the editors for prentice hall publishg we 're the largest publishg company xxmaj america we have a waitg list of people that want to write books on exercise nobody is tellg us how to stay motivated what you told us here today makes more sense than anythg i 've heard anywhere the country we do a book for my company on fitness motivation i said sure that was 30 years ago they have n't gotten motivated to do it yet but what i said was this the problem xxmaj fitness is we do n't know what xxmaj fitness is the reason we do n't know what xxmaj fitness is is because there 's no such thg as generic xxmaj fitness fitness is activity specific until you defe what you 're tryg to get fit for the term has no meang i 've traed xxmaj portl xxmaj trailblazers not change xxmaj seattle xxmaj xxunk i 've traed realestate agents i traed xxunk totally different approach to fitness dependg on what i 'm tryg to get done that fitness program so what is the most universal appeal i can make for physical fitness i came down this health exercise beg called the best medice xxmaj america today outperformg almost every prescribed medication the country terms of its overall impact on our health everythg from colds flu to cancer is beg impacted by exercise but you ca n't just pay lip service to the idea you actually have to do it so how much fitness do we need order to be healthy i said no problem i 'll go through the experts i went to the medical school library xxmaj portl look up how fit you have to be to stay healthy for the most part to fd virtually nothg written on the subject some formation on aerobic exercise but other than that there was nothg there so i would n't talk xxunk that i had known read about asked him they 're defition about physical fitness they 're already tests norms that had been established for the components that could make up total physical fitness but nobody ever packaged it said this is the level of fitness he wanted to have so that 's exactly what i did i put together what i could tend it was a level of fitness sufficient to stay healthy for 1 years took my defition around the medical societies college physiology departments tryg to get somebody to disagree me the date have not found one disagreement on one item on my test so i turned it to a busess that 's still gog now eaverton xxmaj oregon then i wanted to get it even out farther to the general public so i got on the speaker circus your attention is your own public how to measure their own physical fitness that will be sufficient to impact your health both physical mental health by the way the test which you 'll believe will have a copy of later as this here 's your test that you can do at home i want you to be flexible enough to sit on the floor your legs straight reach your fgertips at least five ches past your toes most men can touch your toes some of you have n't seen them five years why it 's flexibility that big a deal because one of the leadg cause is not showg up at work xxmaj america is my back hurts 85 % of the back pa xxmaj america today is beg traced to people tight back muscles caused by weak stomach muscles because you sit so much when the stomach muscles go on vacation the back muscles have to work overtime they xxunk up you bend over to pick up a xxunk on you off work for six weeks strengthen your abdomal muscles stretch your lower back an 85 percent of an 80 to 100 billion dollar problem will either lessen or go away completely but none of you can strengthen your abdomal muscles by takg xxmaj xxunk 's pills you have to exercise i want you to have enough cardiovascular turns to be able to step up down on a 16 accordance box chair or xxunk or an xxunk there for three consecutive mutes take the pulse for 15 seconds multiply the beats by four if your pulse is higher than 1 beats a mute for men 156 beats of a mute 156 beats a mute for women on a sixteen the xxunk step you just failed the test 75 % of the people this room if your typical will fail that test a lot of your runners do n't have good cardiovascular fitness but no has been able expla that to you that test will it 's not my test i did n't make it up it 's out there beg used by the research community then fally keep track of your body fat one lady started a 15 mile a week joggg program a light weight trag hopg to lose weight she gaed eight pounds but dropped six dress sizes because muscle is heavy fat takes up less space this is a sk fold caliper i 've been takg it everywhere i go every time i speak for over 30 years it measures your subcutaneous body fat have to xxunk your body or directly beneath the sk i can xxunk the xxunk of your sk the upper back the xxunk for men upper arm the waistle for women i can fairly actually tell you how much body fat you have women should n't carry more than 20 % men no more than 15 % if you 're carryg more than that you tend to be more prone to everythg from colds flu the cancer by the way for you researchers this is xxmaj xxunk 's formula that i 'm usg for xxunk xxunk i 'll be happy to stay around at the end of the day do body fat percentages for anybody wants to have that done the quickest way i know to clear the room if you do n't have a sk fold caliper keep track of your body shape if you 're losg ches but you 're not losg pounds what are you losg fat that 's a good thg so keep track of your shape for men you should at least drop your keep track of your waistle if you 're droppg body fat you almost always a drop the waistle measurement for men it 's excuse me for women it 's the hip measurement keep track of a hip measurement i found if you 're droppg body fat you almost always are droppg the hip measurement so your body 's givg you the formation you need to motivate you but you have to know how to read your body this is stuff we should have taught you back grade school we did n't a major price for it as a nation fally do n't forget to fit exercise to your busy schedule be basic thgs you want to remember dog that number one i want you to work out everyday i want you to work out first thg the morng go beyond it every day first thg the morng 20 mutes or less then work agast resistance but here are the motivational prciples that say i want you to defe what xxmaj fitness is until you ga agreement about what you 're tryg to do you 're deep trouble then i want you to measure xxmaj fitness measurg xxmaj fitness is a way of identifyg what the need is focusg on the need is the thg that motivates you to do it take it seriously three i want you to reward physical fitness is n't that important to get recognition for dog it i found one of the most effective reward tools i 've ever found a physical fitness is the belief that you 're trsically dog somethg that will impact your health it is the most powerful reason for exercise but beyond that here 's what comes number two a little xxunk

              "xxbos [ ] hi my name is dr . i 'm a licensed psychologist the state of xxmaj texas expert the area of personality disorders because xxmaj october is depression xxmaj awareness xxmaj month i thought i would make a video on depression borderle personality disorder i thk the most important thg to know is that depression is different for those who are diagnosed borderle personality disorder we 're gog to talk about that today we 're gog to talk about how it 's different what those similarities are what makes it complex as well as medication for depression how that tends to impact those borderle personality disorder treatment so let 's get started i hope you enjoy the video so first thg what 's important is that a lot of folks that have are diagnosed borderle personality disorder as well as those traits or at high likelihood to experience depression now when we talk about depression we 're not talkg about sadness sadness is very different sadness tends to be short term tends to be trigger specific which is there somethg that has xxunk you which could be loss of a relationship thgs like that but it does n't last for weeks at a time it does n't impact your ability to function throughout the day okay when one starts to do those thgs lasts for a long time impacts your relationships your ability to go to work or school connect other folks then we 're talkg about depression depression just like borderle personality disorder is also on a contuum okay so you can have mild moderate severe extreme depressive symptoms so the complexity borderle personality disorder it 's really common to see it those that have borderle personality disorder as well as treats now what the research shows is that 83 % of those that are diagnosed borderle personality disorder also meet criteria for major depressive disorder that goes to our depression not sadness but goes to depression which means that it does impact what 's called socioeconomic dysfunction or cause of socioeconomic dysfunction which is that ability to relate to others connect sometimes it 's hygiene issues takg care of yourself sleepg depression a lot of people thk that depression is just sort of a very xxunk dropped mood there is also what 's called xxunk depression an xxunk depression that is when people are very xxunk frustrated xxunk a lot of times you see depression what 's called anxious distress that is that they have all this energy that 's pent up energy it 's a frustrated type of energy but there 's a depressive xxunk to it it 's really complex it that would take a complete video on its own to talk just about depression how that teracts xxunk i want to stay consistent borderle personality disorder here because i thk this is really important a lot of mental health providers are also confused by it certaly the presentation those who do n't specialize personality stores can be very confusg so let 's try to simplify some of that now so when we talk about borderle personality disorder major depressive disorder there is significant symptom overlap the symptoms overlap what happens is is that those borderle personality disorder that they tend to have a xxunk presentation that xxunk depressive symptoms okay certaly suicide risk selfharm which is also seen those a major depressive disorder there 's affective stability those borderle personality disorder traits this this manifests because of talkg about depression that overlap that 's an tense xxunk xxunk okay when we see a borderle personality sorter but also you can see some of that what we remember we talked about anxious distress you can see that as well because you can see folks that are presentg this very xxunk xxunk sad xxunk presentation but it 's frequent temper outbursts these folks xxunk irritability this this xxunk that major depressive disorder anxious distress okay dividuals borderle first now i sort of tend to experience senses of emptess which is all commonly reported those major depressive disorder then there 's also the xxunk paranoia for some of those folks that are on that borderle personality order spectrum they have dissociative symptoms this xxunk depressive psychotic features at times now depression psychotic features that is those that are so depressed that they start to xxunk that can often be confused some mental health providers can be confused thk that it is xxunk delusion it 's actually two societal xxunk xxunk so we have to educate ourselves certaly as mental health providers but also as dividuals that experience this disorder so that sometimes we have to clarify what symptoms were actually seeg we 're gog to talk more about that just a mute okay so vote back that 's that symptom overlap well depression borderle personality disorder but it 's not actually a depressive disorder some cases so let 's talk about that real briefly so now we know that depressive symptoms because 83 % depressive symptom cur occur those borderle personality disorder this but those would borderle personality sort if it 's not depression okay so now we 're gon na step outside of major depressive disorder this is for folks that just have borderle personality disorder okay not just like i 'm xxunk it but just that it 's not comorbid which means it occurs together major depressive sort borderle personality disorder so these are just folks that only have borderle personality disorder if they do n't have major depressive disorder what you see is you 'll see an xxunk stressor okay this is an stance which could be rejection perceived abonment some type of issue but what happens is once that episode that xxunk stressor xxunk or xxunk which means that it goes away it xxunk you see that those depressive symptoms that depressive presentation also xxunk starts to lessen okay so you 're seeg it me it 's more xxunk based than it is long term for extended episodes or periods of time so that is how we know that someone borderle personality disorder does not also have major depressive disorder now that does n't mean right remember because they 're on xxmaj contuum 's we 're not talkg xxunk okay that there are changes but that 's what we look for as mental health providers for those that have borderle personality disorder when there 's an xxunk trigger those xxup pd tend to experience or tend to present emptess you can have creased xxunk which is what we talked about a mute ago but when that trigger or that episode i do n't use the word episode when that trigger or that issue that caused that sense of rejection abonment when that is resolved so maybe the relationship xxunk or the fear is then attenuated or xxunk those depressive symptoms go away it okay but now what happens dividuals xxup pd depression these symptoms can can it can be an issue related to the communication the feelgs about a lot of folks borderle personality or have issues expressg their emotions communicatg them clearly this can clude anger frustration xxunk disappotment all those other thgs so a lot of times what we see part of this confusion for mental health providers as well as for yourself for yourself if you 're experiencg xxup pd or if you have a loved one or someone you know who has this is that they do n't communicate their emotions well they have this this difficulty dog that okay so these states do n't respond what happens is is that they may go to their general primary care physician they may report well you know i 've had this loss of a loved one whether it could be death that were end of a relationship whatever it may be so you go to your primary care physician let 's say or even a psychiatrist you report these episodes these these criteria you start to expla it they 're like oh well this person 's obviously depressed hey now they do n't know about those other xxunk they do n't know about the nuances overlaps other factors that we 're just gettg to so they diagnose there their patient depression they give them medication the problem is is that the medication does n't really xxunk those symptoms okay we 're gog to talk more about this just a little bit so what happens is is that we have to educate the dividuals by therapy is so important for those borderle personality disorder because we have to teach these folks all right well we have to learn how to communicate our feelgs if you 're one of those dividuals that you have trouble kd of expressg your feelgs i do have an emotions exercise on my website you 're welcome to download try it to try to build up your emotional telligence skills your communication of emotions which is really important because if you have these seemgly depressive episodes that are trigger related okay then you need to be able to communicate that to identify those emotions specifically that trigger if this is confusg we 're gon na keep talkg about it to try to clarify it for you but it is a confusg process even for mental health providers so if you 're confused it 's understable okay so let me just simplify really quick so we 're talkg about is that the confusion for the dividual as well as the provider of care for those xxup dpd is that the dividual xxup pd has trouble effectively communicatg their emotions they 've experienced a trigger or loss so they start to express certaly feel are managg dealg these depressive like symptoms but they do n't qualify for major depressive disorder which is where medication is helpful okay so let 's let 's keep gog because there 's even more of a question this goes to the complexity a lot of folks who who write me stuff underst because they 're livg the complexity of xxup pd okay it is complex it 's but it 's not a lost cause i always try to add that is that this is a xxunk disorder it really really is let 's go a little further because it used to be believed that borderle personality was what 's called an affective disorder an affective disorder that would be your depression all right you also have an effect an emotional component right so they used to believe that xxup pd was like bipolar sorter i 've contemplated dog a video just on bipolar disorder i 'm not gog to get to bipolar disorder here because of all the details that 's that that 's that that is composed of bipolar the difference between borderle but i 'll lightly touch on it here so that you have some clarity so what happens is xxup pd is often confused as an affective disorder this could be bipolar or depression but what happens is if the proof is the treatment of depression does not lessen those xxup pd symptoms okay so let 's say you have an dividual who has major depressive disorder that is comorbid till they occur together xxup pd that dividual goes to their psychiatrist their primary care physician they get let 's say xxmaj xxunk or an xxup xxunk or another medication for depression what will happen is is you may see those depressive symptoms xxunk or lessen but the xxup pd stuff still is present those xxunk that xxunk that anger that emptess that chronic emptess that fear of abonment those other factors do n't xxunk they do n't go away medication okay so that 's that 's a big dicator all right that what we 're talkg about is xxup pd that could be comorbid or could not be major depressive disorder goes for bipolar as well you 'll see that those manic phases xxunk phases those depressive episodes become attenuated or controlled or steady but you still have those reactions those those xxup pd feelgs other types of factors we 're gog to talk a little bit more about medication xxunk of symptoms just a mute okay so but here 's what 's terestg this is what the research shows is that treatment for depression does n't lower xxup pd symptoms but xxup pd treatment treatment for xxup pd xxunk depressive symptoms right i mean thk about it because the manifestation of those depressive symptoms comes from xxup pd if you deal xxup pd you can man to the but if you just treat the depression it does n't lessen the xxup pd because the xxup pd is a larger component that is over the depression okay i 'm gon na get more to it so do n't do n't get frustrated be like what the hell is this guy talkg about i 'm gon na clarify as we keep gog okay so what 's terestg is so we also want to talk about early experiences okay i 'm gon na dump xxunk a little bit talk about those xxup pd that have these early experiences the early environments for a lot of folks xxup pd but not just xxup pd okay that have had secure attachment patterns combed anxious sensitive temperament later childhood trauma which could be abused psychological abuse emotional abuse other types of abuse factors that may xxunk dividuals to xxup pd early onset depressive disorder as well as assignment disorder now xxunk disorder is so here 's depression when we talk about a severity that xxunk disorder is not as severe but it 's this contual sort of feelg all right there 's no other way to describe it then folks who just feel blue they do n't get excited about anythg everythg seems kd of very xxunk there this is not meant to be humorous it 's meant to be as an example but there used to be similar on xxmaj saturday xxmaj night xxmaj live called debbie xxunk so debbie xxunk she presented somethg similar to dis xxunk disorder never really happy tends to be xxunk negative tends to not enjoy thgs a lot of xxmaj xxunk which is that you do n't enjoy thgs you do n't enjoy experiences you have you tend not to you tend to lose terest thgs you want to enjoy but this happens for a longer period of time but it 's not as severe as your major depressive disorder okay so let 's let 's keep gog so now we 've talked about early early experiences let 's talk about medication because this this is very tricky the xxmaj united xxmaj states seventy percent of all actually of the world 's medications consumed the xxmaj united xxmaj states what 's terestg as far as medication is that there is limited research that actually shows evidence for the use of xxunk or is like xxunk xxunk or xxunk fatty acids the management of depression as it is a component of xxup pd okay but the problem is is there 's no real solid data on how to guide clicians or xxunk or primary care physicians choosg a specific treatment for depression that is comorbid xxup pd okay now there is creasg pressure right around the world okay about the limited use of medication for xxup pd okay because of its limited effectiveness concerns about obesity which is an issue a lot of times medication other types of health problems can occur due to long term takg medication that you need to talk to your doctor about when we have an dividual borderle personality disorder that also has these comorbid disorders we 're just talkg about major depressive disorder this video okay so what happens is is that you do n't have a xxunk of your xxup pd symptoms so you go back to your doctor okay you say well i mean you know nothg 's really change i 'm still depressed i 'm still xxunk i still have what we 're callg anxious to stress you know so what happens is they give you another medication on top of the other medication this is called xxunk okay so but if you 've listened to my other videos you 've heard me talk about core structure surface structure that 's exactly what we 're talkg about now surface structure would be your depressive episodes features criterion components your core structure is that xxup pd is that borderle personality disorder your core structure a drives or impacts your surface structure okay which this case we 're talkg major depressive disorder now if you can xxunk you have to deal surface structure behavior but that core structure is still present so therapy because medication addresses surface structure does not address core structure it would be great if we have medication for personality but we do n't so that 's why treatment this is research been done sce the 50 that has been found more xxunk than medication even as medications get better now i 'm not sayg do n't take your medication please do n't you have to talk to your psychiatrist or your primary care physician this is not a video about should you take your medication at all you need to talk to a mental health provider or a medical provider any time your thk about changg your medication that 's really important because you 're dealg your bra your body you do n't want to have different types of side effects xxunk reactions if you make those choices okay so let 's just be clear about that so when we talk about xxunk now what happens is is that you 're gettg medications aga so first surface structure your medications are beg prescribed to deal these different components xxunk depression loss of terest lack of ve other types of factors so this xxunk starts to occur which is you 're gettg prescribed different medications for different symptoms so now you can have four or five i 've had clients that were on ne different medications to deal symptom presentations related to xxup pd now it does n't mean they were n't comorbid anxiety xxup ptsd other thgs but their core structure of xxup pd kept drivg this surface structure i really hope that this is makg its own i know it 's complex so it 's tryg to go slow be clear so xxunk now this tends to occur aga because you go to your doctor you 're distress that 's alright right you want somethg to feel better your your doctor wants to help you right so they 're driven to try to manage alleviate these symptoms as best they can right so as you present more symptoms they are identifyg other medications that might be able to help you okay now one study found that compared people that just had depression people borderle personality disorder were twice as likely to have taken xxunk two times more likely to have received an xxunk medication more than six times likely to have received mood xxunk there are more than ten times likely to have use xxunk okay so that says a lot that goes right back to the client example i gave you is that you 're presentg different symptoms your doctor wants to help you they 're driven to help you they keep seeg the symptom presentation so they 're dressg each of those symptoms different medications okay but the core structure stays which is why therapy is so important okay what this means is is that you want to explore your options your doctor do your best to have a treatment team if you can okay so as a psychologist i have talked to primary care physicians xxunk we have been a treatment team sometime of two sometimes three to help this dividual get stable function as you build these abilities to manage defe underst your emotions then you become more xxunk xxunk which is which is my goal for a lot of my clients the xxmaj hat personality sorter is an empowerment sight you need less medication because you 're buildg these skills to manage it but they 're beg treated by a psychiatrist by myself as well sometimes there 's a case work or sometimes as a social worker sometimes there 's a licensed professional counselor an xxup xxunk so that we 're helpg this dividual build these skills teract appropriately the medication is not needed as much so you can start to lessen some of those over time perhaps they go away you do n't need the medication now that 's some cases aga you do n't want to do this on your own you want to do it metal medical providers mental health providers who actually know can help you give you the support that you need order to do that okay so let 's talk about a little more we 're about medication or therapy okay so no research has shown that major depressive xxunk is not a significant predictor for outcome of xxup pd we talked about that right is that if you treat depression that does n't lessen those borderle personality sort of symptoms criteria other factors but borderle personality disorder is a significant predictor of outcome for major depressive disorder so if you treat the borderle personality disorder that can lessen successfully you start lessen some of those surface structures surface presentations issues that will lessen the depressive symptoms but xxunk the depressive symptoms say well personality source we 're not gog to worry about that we 're just gog to treat depression the xxup pd stuff still stays there you may have had that this experience okay is that you 're on different medications you 're like well it 's not changg all of this that 's because this is xxup pd but it 's changg this which is the depression okay so now these studies right so what they found is they recommended the treatment of borderle personality disorder hey psychotherapy what should happen is the priority so when you have this major depression you have xxup pd they cooccur so their comorbid when they occur together that the mental health provider the treatment provider the psychotherapy should n't focus on the depressive symptoms would focus on the components of xxup pd which goes back to dealg that core content stuff that we talked about as opposed to just dealg surface structure but i will say this as an aside if you have severe extreme high moderate depressive symptoms it tend not to show up for for therapy they 're too depressed they 're not motivated therapy tends to have no forward movement so that 's where medication can help a little bit you can xxunk some of those depressive symptoms enough to get the client or yourself motivated to come to treatment to deal the xxup pd because if we can control lessen the xxup pd we control lessen the major depressive disorder okay so now different psychotherapy xxmaj xxunk found to be really effective for borderle personality disorder there 's xxunk behavioral therapy there is xxup dt dialectical behavioral therapy there 's terpersonal therapy others that are found to be really effective okay to deal xxup pd lessen the symptoms of xxup pd get those under control okay so

if you fd this video to be terestg or helpful please like it subscribe to my channel hello this is dr . gre today 's question asks if i can take a look at fantasies associated personality pathology i 've had a number of questions specifically about narcissistic antisocial person xxunk so i answer these questions a few different ways look at the personality disorders all ten of them go through just what types of fantasies we might expect those personality sorters then i 'll look at ten examples of cluster personality pathology fantasies so fantasy has an terestg place personality pathology counselg some counselg modalities clients talk about their fantasies what those fantasies mean to them they explore fantasy order to get to some sort of therapeutic benefit this is particularly common psychodynamic therapy therapies that are similar to psychodynamic most fantasies are harmless fantasizg is extraordarily common technically a fantasy is when somebody images somethg that is xxunk or impossible sometimes fantasies can lead to positive outcomes even though the fantasy itself can rarely be realized for example somebody might have a fantasy of becomg the best actor who has ever lived they might work hard at studyg actg gog to a lot of auditions they might become a good actor on the other h sometimes fantasies can terfere legitimate goals every now then fantasies can be destructive frighteng when it comes to personality pathology the personality characteristics that really st out terms of fantasy would come from cluster so that would be antisocial narcissistic borderle histrionic xxmaj personality xxmaj disorder z ' the level of fantasizg is so high narcissistic personality disorder that fantasizg is actually one of these symptom criteria fantasies of unlimited success power xxunk beauty or ideal love although as i 've said many times xxmaj prior videos i view the term unlimited as too restrictive here i prefer the term exaggerated because not every dividual xxup npd wants unlimited excess sometimes they just want a highly unrealistic quantity of success now the ma trait associated fantasy is openness to experience so if we look at this from the perspective of the five factor model if somebody is high openness to experience they are xxunk creative they tend to xxunk off to fantasy if we combe personality pathology relatively high openness to experience we get fantasies that may seem unusual some cases antisocial it 's important note here that there is a significant difference between havg a fantasy actg on a fantasy although the presence of troublg fantasies would dicate that counsellg would be a good idea many of the severe consequences troublg fantasies are realized when people try to make those fantasies to a reality so here i 'm gog to go through some of the fantasies that have been associated personality disorders then aga really xxunk down to cluster personality pathology give some specific examples when talkg about specific fantasies that i have become aware of formation has been changed to protect the nocent so as i mentioned fantasies are fairly common most of the 10 personality sellers have some relationship to fantasy just like all personality types would have some relationship so just quickly gog through the person is orders lookg at the fantasy type that might be associated that disorder from cluster a personality pathology paranoid person is order here we sometimes see fantasies of beg able to see know everythg to satisfy fears about beg spied on so somebody 's paranoid they may fantasize about beg able to detect when people are actually out to get them so they could have somethg like xray vision or an ability to read mds or just somethg that would let them know who 's tryg to cause harm to them movg one to schizoid i have n't noticed too much the way of fantasy this disorder dividuals this disorder tend to be xxunk to social situations they do n't often come for treatment so when i was kd of thkg through these 10 personal xxunk i really could n't come up a fantasy that 's specifically associated i ran to the same thg xxunk a xxunk perhaps there could be some fantasies here of beg accepted by others because of the social anxiety component we see sometimes what 's a typical but general i do n't really see this one strongly connected to fantasy now movg on to cluster personality pathology antisocial we see fantasies of committg gettg away crime fantasies of domation aga i 'll talk more about this cluster as i get to the different examples for cluster narcissistic we see fantasies about beg powerful wealthy beg admired by everybody the world about fdg a perfect romantic partner about controllg other people so we see some overlap here antisocial borderle we see fantasies of fdg one perfect mate who offers absolute security histrionic fantasies about beg popular beg the center of attention movg on to cluster c personality pathology startg avoidant sometimes here avoidant we see fantasies of havg close relationships now some of the time people thk about of xxmaj xxunk xxunk sort of they thk that somebody is tryg to avoid social situations because they do n't want to be close to people but usually people this disorder do want to have close relationships they just have a strong fear of embarrassment rejection dependent personality disorder we see fantasies of fdg one person that the dividual can really count on to support them so somewhat similar to borderle obsessivecompulsive personality order we see fantasies of a world where everybody can be productive everythg can be productive nobody 's tryg to terfere that productivity so we really see fantasies of everythg gog perfectly everythg runng smoothly so now centerg on cluster personality disorders i 'm really focusg here mostly on narcissistic to some extent antisocial to a lesser extent borderle histrionic what i 've noticed about narcissistic fantasies from my clical experience from the research literature is that there 's quite a bit of overlap these fantasies antisocial fantasies which actually makes a lot of sense given that we see a lot of cooccurrence between these two person these structures as well as comorbidity between the two personalities xxunk the dsm so narcissistic antisocial personality disorders the official diagnosis it 's unusual for a narcissist to have psychopathic tennessee 's it 's not unusual for a psychopath to have narcissistic tendencies at the xxunk clical level these traits hold together fairly well this has been xxunk the research on the dark triad the third trait of course beg xxmaj xxunk now the official personality disorders only capture certa aspects of psychopathy narcissism antisocial personality disorder really tends to capture impulsivity irresponsibility crimal components of psychopathy this is referred to as factor to psychopathy or sociopathy the diagnosis really does n't capture the superficial charm very well it does n't capture every aspect of the manipulation like we would see factor 1 psychopathy now a narcissistic personality xxunk tends to capture the griose side of narcissism characterized by domance confidence beg resistant to criticism extraversion it tends to miss vulnerable narcissism which is characterized by distrust shame xxunk xxunk a hyper sensitivity to criticism as we 'll see from these fantasies both factor 1 factor 2 psychopathy play a role both griose vulnerable narcissism play a role so all that md let 's get started the 10 examples of cluster personality fantasies these examples i 'm gog to alternate usg a male a female as the dividual who is havg the fantasy so the first fantasy is the fantasy of revenge here i 'm gog to start a male this fantasy is most associated psychopathy narcissism occasionally borderle especially when the dividual is seekg revenge on a love terest so this fantasy this could be revenge on people who rejected the dividual who bullied them xxunk them or who ignored them so lookg at the example here we see a man antisocial tendencies psychopathy who xxunk about how he will attack who bullied him when he was grade school or high school his fantasy he is really strikg fear to their hearts right so he targets the first dividual hurts them harms him some way potentially even kills them other people who bullied him start to see this like the news or somethg realize that he 's gog after everybody that bullied him so they 're trapped they ca n't really do anythg about it they 're stuck a lot of fear anxiety they 're unable to stop his xxunk so this fantasy he may have some type of super power we can xxunk law enforcement get away these crimes movg to the second example this is a fantasy of beauty so aga here i 'm movg to usg a female as the example this is associated narcissism to some extent borderle histrionic xxmaj personality pathology so at this example we see a woman who thks of herself as xxunk or average her fantasy she will suddenly be seen by others as beg exceedgly attractive so it 's not always about change the dividual but rather about change how other people view the dividual right so this example she 's not becomg more attractive she 's been attractive the whole time along people just ca n't recognize it there 's somethg blockg them from seeg it the fantasy of course is that obstacle is removed everybody realizes how beautiful she really is movg to the third fantasy this is the fantasy of md control this one is most closely associated narcissism borderle this is often to make somebody love the dividual to establish control or to escape responsibility so at the example here we see a man who commits an assault perhaps as part of another fantasy like a fantasy of revenge he 's arrested tried he uses his md control abilities to make sure the jury fds him not guilty so he 's xxunk of the assault but he 's only usg the md control on the members of the jury other people like the prosecutors the police they know he 's guilty right they 're not beg controlled so they would thk that he 's guilty the whole time along so essentially the dividual can xxunk xxunk the prosecutors the police confused them right how is he beg found not guilty by this jury when the facts clearly dicate that he committed these acts of revenge these assaults terestgly i 've actually seen this fantasy a number of times when i first heard this fantasy i kd of wondered why the fantasy was n't to have this xxunk ability over everybody volved like why even be arrested the first place right just xxunk the police be done it but there 's somethg xxunk to the narcissist or the psychopath to commit a crime for some people to know that he 's really guilty then get away it through his special ability whatever it is md control or some other ability it 's not really as entertag for this dividual unless they have this satisfaction of this group of people who aga kd of realize that somethg bad really happened the person 's gettg away it so that 's why i thk the md control these fantasies is often restricted to just a few people like 12 people jury for example movg to the fourth fantasy this is the fantasy of beg accepted by all those who rejected the dividual this is common narcissism borderle so the example here would be a woman who achieves a high level of popularity she becomes like a famous dividual this forces people who rejected her to admit her greatness beg for her forgiveness so now she 's able to hang out those people build all the friendships that she origally wanted so this one really is n't about revenge it 's about xxunk what the woman believes that she was entitled to the entire time along she wanted to be popular she wanted people to accept her they did n't this fantasy her becomg exceedgly popular or famous this can set that right this can make the people who rejected her realize the error of their ways so this aga kd of xxunk her back to where she wanted to be movg to fantasy number five this is a fantasy of dog somethg so helpful to society that people will admire the dividual this is often known as communal narcissism right of course this has a strong tie to narcissism not so much of course to antisocial borderle or histrionic so the fantasy example here would be a man starts a nonprofit to help the xxunk gets a great deal of media exposure everybody loves him for helpg people he seems like he is xxunk he is magnificent he 's an credible person who 's there to help xxmaj society now terestgly these fantasies of communal narcissism sometimes grow creasgly authentic meang they start to become selfcentered back toward what we normally thk of narcissism narcissism is often thought of it 's much more authentic than communal so these fantasies of communal narcissism might be popular kd of early somebody 's life but then aga become more selfcentered over time that will be reflected the newer versions of the fantasy fantasy number six is the fantasy of redemption success this is more common vulnerable narcissism borderle of course those two constructs have a lot of overlap between them so this one is really about beg falsely accused then xxunk so the example here a woman is accused of stealg money from a bank perhaps video surveillance that captures her removg money from a bank xxunk but it turns out that she actually prevented the theft perhaps she was movg the money from the bank xxunk to a place where would be safe so the real crimals could n't fd the money they were tryg to steal now this seems like an unusual fantasy but i 've also encountered this one several times i was really tryg to thk about why this fantasy occurs terms of my clical experience talkg to people the only thg i could really come up is that the movement is really tremendous when gog from beg hated to beg loved right so we thk about it on a scale where beg neutral havg people look at someone just thk really nothg about them that 's a zero beg hated would be a negative ten beg loved would be a ten what happens here at this fantasy is that somebody can go from negative ten all the way to ten stead of gog from zero to ten so it 's really about the change it 's the amount of change that occurs so the fantasy is more xxunk because now people really have to change their perception a great deal stead of just aga gog from neutral to likg the dividual so an unusual fantasy aga but i have seen this many times this xxmaj redemption success fantasy pattern fantasy number seven is a fantasy of beg chosen as great right so i see this mostly narcissism every now then psychopathy among all these fantasies that volve unlikely outcomes this one seems to be particularly unlikely yet like many of these i 've actually seen this particular fantasy quite a few times so the example here highly telligent credibly advanced xxunk come to the planet xxmaj earth choose a man to be a great leader on earth they xxunk him to be charge of the whole planet on top of this they give him super powers perhaps somethg like the ability to fly credible strength beg immune from any type of weapons that are available on earth so we see kd of aga a fantasy that really stretches thgs now this fantasy this fantasy beg satisfied but the person beg made to be a leader of the world this man now can address his other fantasies right so this one kd of sets thgs off it starts thgs he gas these superpowers his power general now he can live out all of his fantasies on the planet so i thk this addresses the sense of beg special unique we see narcissism if people on earth refused to recognize how credible the man is perhaps an advanced super telligent alien race will recognize him everybody on earth will have to acknowledge how they were xxunk so we kd of see familiar themes this fantasy right so people that rejected the dividual will now be forced to accept him movg to fantasy number 8 this is a romantic fantasy we see this narcissism borderle histrionic we rarely see this psychopathy the research would assure this is sometimes referred to as the hysterical fantasy the examples usually feature a narcissistic woman who has the fantasy which is kd of terestg because you would thk would be more tied to histrionic xxmaj personality xxmaj disorder but aga it 's featured mostly around narcissism the example here a woman believes that one particular man who she has not met yet will fd her see value her that no one else could see who loved her more than anyone could ever love her this love will go on for a long time hundreds of years or even forever right as a fantasy so anythg 's possible this romantic partner will save her defend her protect her even heal any types of difficulties that she has whether they 're related to mental health or bad memories or trauma of course medical problems could be addressed as well so this dividual is really a xxunk to the woman now many times when i 've seen this fantasy there 's actually been a specific man the fantasy so the woman has a person md she believes that person will recognize her aga do all these different thgs protect her save her so movg now to the nth fantasy this is domation we see variations of scenarios where a man has control over one woman or a group of women this is most closely associated psychopathy narcissism this is kd of terestg because the degree to which those two traits are pronounced really seems to determe the type of fantasy we see this context of domation so i 'll provide an example from the narcissistic side from the psychopathic side so lookg at narcissism a narcissistic man xxunk about women who live an apartment complex he owns so he 's the only male there this apartment complex could hold potentially hundreds of other people aga other than him they would all be women now the narcissistic fantasy the women are there of their own free will because they all love the narcissist they want to be him of course the narcissist wants that love so essentially this fantasy the women are all competg to be this one man so this example he 's not really usg force he 's not really domatg a traditional sense but he is a domant position right they all want to be them this fantasy aga there 's no competition from other men so as we move over to the psychopathic side of this there 's some similarities but also some market differences so we see the same apartment complex the same math right we see one psychopathic man a bunch of women except the psychopathic fantasy the women are prisoners so the psychopath domates them he can do what he wants his fantasy of course he often would now the more psychopathy we see the more this can get to the area of somethg like murder so it 's some psychopathy here we see maybe some xxunk but more psychopathy it gets even darker aga up to an cludg murder it extreme psychopathy it would really just be about murder right there would n't be any sexual relationships or anythg like that it would simply just move right to murder so really when we look at narcissism psychopathy we have to look at the levels of each one aga that kd of determes which way this fantasy can go i 've also seen versions of this fantasy where the dividual the fantasy kd of starts out beg loved like the women are chasg the man but some of the women the man is more aggressive right it 's not where they 're really chasg him he 's chasg them so the fantasy both of those types of approach avoidance are occurrg so the psychopathic xxmaj tennessee can domate sometimes the narcissistic xxmaj tennessee can domate sometimes that can move back forth the same dividual aga as expressed by the fantasies the changes the fantasies now this fantasy of course does n't have to volve an apartment complex i 've seen examples were volved an entire country where the man was the only male an entire country the whole country is full of women i 've seen it were volves a mansion a motel a town a xxmaj space xxmaj station another planet so i can entire planet other than xxmaj earth i 've seen it were volves an entire xxunk so aga there really no balance at all on fantasy we see these fantasies go to credible extremes of course this particular fantasy is especially dark as compared to a lot of these other fantasies now movg to the last fantasy number 10 this is a fantasy of sufferg so we mostly see this narcissism borderle it 's an unusual fantasy the goal seems to be to get attention so the example here a woman has sustaed staggerg losses of family members when she was the only survivor a horrific xxunk accent this causes her to jaw sympathy from people around the world right so notice the sufferg here is really the loss of other people the woman 's not necessarily sufferg physically like she was n't necessarily jured the accident so this suggests a possibility that she 's actually callous right that those losses do n't mean anythg to her this of course would be more common if the narcissistic tendency here the borderle xxmaj tennessee also had psychopathy so we can see how this fantasy becomes darker as more psychopathy enters to the equation i 've also seen examples this where the woman was hurt where she did mourn the loss of the family members right so it does n't have to be callous it does n't have to be psychopathic that 's just a possibility this fantasy also seems to have some overlap xxunk disorder right there 's this idea that the person will voluntarily suffer even hurt themselves order to attract sympathy attention so there are some different fantasies some examples i covered the 10 personality xxunk very quickly then took the more detailed look at cluster personality pathology those 10 examples aga some of them quite disturbg i 've even seen many actually that are more disturbg than what i 've talked about here aga fantasies do n't have any limits so somebody can start out a fantasy that 's a little worrisome that fantasy can develop grow over time that 's somethg that counselors we need to be on the lookout for when fantasy start out kd of mild or playful we 're kd of normal range then start to become distorted dark over time it 's important to be on the lookout for creasg levels of aggression violence themes like revenge domation so we know whenever i talk about topics like fantasy personality pathology there will be a variety of opions please put any opions thoughts the comments section they always generate an terestg dialogue as always i hope you found my analysis of this topic to be terestg thanks for watchg,xxbos i always felt like the difference between the xxmaj united xxmaj states the xxmaj russian space programs could be xxunk up by the toilet because it was dicative of what a lot of the differences were i 'm xxmaj mike xxmaj xxunk this is how hygiene is different space [ ] hygiene space is very important you 're gon na have to do the same sort of thgs that you do want earth like xxunk your teeth keepg yourself clean usg the bathroom all of these thgs are very important very different because you 're dog them space so they do require some trag you want to do it correctly because if you do n't it could lead to trouble on earth we deal flush xxunk if that 's available hopefully to you you do what you need to do then you clean yourself up then it 's on to the xxunk of your day but space it 's different the flights that i had space were on the space show on the space shuttle we had a xxunk it was called the xxup xxunk the waste contament system i thk that was primarily because if he had a problem you did n't want to call xxunk we have a problem we xxunk up the toilet it did n't have a lot of privacy but it had some it had a privacy curta the xxup xxunk had a xxunk for ure for you to urate to a xxunk more or less for you to xxunk to we want to use the word xxunk what do you want to xxunk okay we 're not gon na offend then he went around a planet here okay takg a pee on the xxmaj space xxmaj shuttle was was pretty pretty quick easy the holes came an attachment that you would put on which was a xxunk so everyone had their own we did n't share xxunk it was a little xxunk you 'd open up the xxunk there would be the seven xxunk you would take the appropriate one attach it to the ure collection xxunk then you would turn the system off what it does is it creates a little xxunk so that it 'll take the liquid down the xxunk to the tank when that tank reached a level that it was full we would do a ure dump out to space it would kd of xxunk disappear more or less the vacuum of space so it was okay to dump to dump ure out there if the xxmaj sun was shg who was shg through the dumped ure beauty kd of like a rabow effect that was kd of cool when you were fished you would then turn off the system you would remove your xxunk you would clean it you would put it back its appropriate space then you would clean up a little bit the quickest way to do that was just a wet wipe we had h sanitizer you could use some of that cause you do n't want to spread any germs or anythg like that you want to be very cautious after you get a little experience you could do other thgs like xxunk upside down this was a challenge given to me by a more experienced xxunk who said it is possible to pee upside down you should try it you can you just flip yourself upside down i need to be a little more careful you do n't want to do that on day one you know you do n't want a hot dog it too much but it is possible to pee upside down which is kd of cool i 've done that as well people on the space station is a little bit different than what we had on the space shuttle you still pee to a xxunk but unlike these dividual xxunk it 's a big yellow xxunk one size fits all but on the space station they xxunk the ure along xxunk sweat xxunk all that water is collected then it is cleaned it is treated it is reused so as my friend xxmaj don xxmaj xxunk says today 's coffee is tomorrow 's coffee xxunk space was very volved because you really do n't want to mess this up this is our xxunk xxunk right here i 'll show you but you see it 's pretty small so you have to have pretty good aim the key to this the way it was explaed to us i agree the key to this is alignment next to our real shuttle toilet the xxunk we had a practice toilet that was not for xxunk it was made for alignment practice this is actually one of xxup nasa 's xxunk darkest secrets that we 're gog over here this camera poted up at you when you sat on this you had a call xxunk xxup tv right here so you would see on the camera whether or not you were aligned the target area you would sit on there like you went on maybe on it like you thk you 're on a regular on a regular toilet here then you check you 're alive like xxunk i 'm go we 're near where i want to be on this when you get yourself perfectly aligned the idea was to then try to xxunk what that body position was so on the front of this thg there were like little platform to put your feet underneath okay as you 're sittg on this thg but you can still you but could still come off the back of it that 's not good so order to keep you but on the toilet seat we had these two little arms that would press you to the seat actually to help myself get the right position as i put my arms up like this like i was ridg a xxunk i thought of xxmaj peter xxmaj xxunk a movie called xxmaj easy xxmaj xxunk that was n't good alignment for me after you take care of busess we had a couple thgs to watch out for we had a mirror that we would be traed to then take from there was xxunk to the wall we would take this mirror then put it behd us so as we got off the toilet we saw if anythg was followg us if you get that what i mean okay if there was somethg followg you you would sit back down do whatever you thk was necessary to make sure whatever was followg you off the seat remaed where am i supposed to do you do a little shake if you need to then if thgs get really out of control we have disfectant xxunk just to make sure we clean up here the numberone stuff can sort of go all over the place if you do n't aim correctly the xxunk remaed the toilet we led all of our xxunk then the toilet was serviced once we got on the ground on occasion people had xxunk up the procedure therefore broken the toilet that 's really bad if you break the toilet you ca n't xxunk the toilet on a space shuttle the backup to that was what we called xxmaj xxunk bags that had xxunk that you would tape to your xxunk that 's the way they xxunk xxmaj xxunk they did not have a regular toilet to use that seemed extremely unpleasant right so we did not want to get to the xxmaj xxunk bags so that was kd of like enough to scare you you would make sure you did the procedure correctly on earth cleanless is very important what most of us do is we 'll take a shower every day brush your teeth very important to brush your teeth brush your hair we need to shave but space it 's a little different water is somewhat of a resource particularly on the space station so we want to xxunk what we have a big shower would use these those lots of water so we really ca n't afford to do that so what we did space what the xxunk still do space is you take more of a sponge bath where you have one xxunk that you would put a little water on then you could put some soap to it then soap yourself off this is our body wash so there 's soap side of here we would fill this just like a drk bag as a valve at the top we can squeeze the liquid soap out of it after we added water to it then you would hang all of those thgs up to dry the ventilation system the xxunk of air will allow it to dry space space is a problem so the xxunk we use were packed very tightly on the space station now they have ones they look like almost like a xxunk xxunk xxup nasa autumn there the wash clothes are kd of cool but you want to pack them as tightly as you can the xxunk we have these big xxunk xxunk you can get on earth that 's that happeng space they 're generally thner xxunk but pretty xxunk so they work really well the use of water is so important for our life havg clean water a lot of places do n't have clean water source right so we have this problem space where we need to have water to live for drkg for hygiene for preparg food because a lot of our food items are xxunk so you add a little bit of water to those so we 've done a good job of learng how to effectively xxunk water be able to clean ure water we use for different thgs so that it 's xxunk aga so that is the type of technology that can be very useful parts of the world where gettg clean water is an issue washg our hair usually requires a lot of water on earth but space we use xxunk less xxunk the xxmaj xxunk is right there it 's got xxunk on it if i wanted to put it down i could stick it to the wall it 's got a piece of xxmaj xxunk tape on the top so it wo n't leak xxmaj xxunk tape is space approved tape so what i did was add a little bit of water to a wash cloth then xxunk xxunk then get a good xxunk gog then aga take a towel just dry off my hair the xxunk it worked great because you did n't have to xxunk her hair that way you generally used your own xxunk towel that was somewhat of a personal item yeah xxunk the way i shave on earth i use xxunk cream a a xxunk on the sk that requires runng water you can do that space they do have a special xxunk cream you can use they call it xxunk edge you can also use a xxunk but then you 've got to do somethg the cream the xxunk that are comg off what i xxunk for was an electric xxunk the xxunk were contaed the unit itself then you would clean it if you needed to very carefully a vacuum we generally get a haircut pretty close at a time that we 're gon na fly space on the space station you 're up there for six months so you need to be concerned about a haircut so for that to have an electric xxmaj xxunk aga that 's attached directly to a xxunk so that as you create hair it 'll get sucked right to the vacuum stuff like dead sk cuttg your fgernails or xxunk you want to do that stuff near the vent so that it gets captured by the vent then you can clean it off this was a xxunk that i took me to space xxup nasa could provide you the stard xxunk xxunk but if you provided one of your own they would pack it for you fly it you could use that space if he had a favorite xxunk so i saw this as an opportunity to do somethg fun so i went out purchased this xxunk xxunk to have space xxup nasa then converted it to a space xxunk by puttg a piece of xxunk on it space you brush your teeth the same way more or less you used xxunk toothpaste then you xxunk your mouth but then the question is what do you do that stuff there are two options you can either be a xxunk or a xxunk if you 're a xxunk i felt that was a little more complicated because you have to you know sp to a xxunk deal it so what i do is i just swallow the toothpaste space sounds glamorous does n't it i wear contact xxunk even xxunk my contact xxunk some guys did n't want to do that but i always warm i figured you know as long as i was n't messg my eyes i 'd be ok there was a concern though the xxunk about us havg clean hs when we put the contacts so he had xxunk i guess you can use on earth as well if you were concerned i did not lose a contact space i felt very fortunate that the xxunk to do laundry on earth is fairly straightforward then we have maches that help us but space it 's different because we do n't have a lot of water space it is hard to wash clothes on the space shuttle we had a different shirt everyday we had a different pair of xxunk every day we had pants shorts that would be worn for a few days so we did n't do laundry we just packed that stuff up once we wore the shirt we put it a kd of a clothg b but it was like a big bag then that stuff would be returned to xxmaj earth cleaned returned to us clean on the space station they kd of rely on the supply ships to brg them the new clothes the dirty laundry will get packaged put to a supply ship has been xxunk of supplies now becomes a dumpster that stuff will burn up under the entry it does however on occasion get xxunk space what you smell space the cab is generally each other when we led on the shuttle after this situation for a few weeks the people that would open up the hatch would get a xxunk of this be like was usually the reaction the more experienced recovery technicians would know that ahead of time be prepared for you go to your xxunk to xxunk that becomes your dividual xxunk it does not come its own toilet the rule was on xxunk days the two people gog out to xxunk have first xxunk on the toilet you want it take care of that as best you can before you go out then you put your xxunk on to make it xxunk proof some nice person who packs our stuff writes front on the xxunk so we do n't put it on backwards then we put our fancy xxunk xxunk on then we start gettg dressed the rest of the space you know once you 're locked side of there you have no access to the toilet any longer so if you 're gon na go you 're gon na do it the the xxunk you 're really discouraged from xxunk that thg because you really do n't want that stuff gettg loose there the xxunk should work but why take the risk when we were launchg on the space shuttle we were gog to be puttg a xxunk on as well when we got dressed so you 'd want to use the bathroom at crew quarters then you put on your xxunk a xxunk you go out to the launch xxunk now on the launch xxunk itself there is a toilet we call it the last toilet on earth because you use it then you go to space the last thg you do before you go flyg or go to a xxunk where you 're gon na be stuck is you go to the bathroom it 's part of the checklist we do have a xxunk control so you try to keep yourself cool while you 're xxunk so you do n't sweat xxunk but still you 're gon na be movg around you 're gon na be xxunk a bit one thg you learn aviation as you go to different xxunk thgs are gog to exp meang your stomach i remember the the who was a xxmaj navy guy that was trag us this he said your social xxunk go out the wdow when you 're get side of the airplane you know you might have some extra gas so he said you do n't worry about that you because you do n't want to get a xxunk so the same thg is your xxunk but if you break wd side of your xxunk you 're the only guy that 's gog to be smellg it you wo n't smell it i thk for the future hygiene of course is gon na be important on the xxunk it was a shortterm issue you know you could conta all the xxunk for a couple weeks on the space station now they have a better plan because you 're up there longer periods of time but still the proximity to the earth gives you some advantages you can get xxunk of clothg you can get xxunk of water you can get xxunk of a lot of the thgs you need because we 're low xxmaj earth orbit once we start movg further away from the planet it 's gog to be harder to do that xxunk it 's not gog to be as easy as it is now so i thk we are gog to need a way to wash clothes when we go further away from our planet we 're gog to need a way to do that that does n't require a lot of water also we 're able to conta a lot of the the germs of bacteria we try to go to space very healthy you have a quarante period ahead of time so you do n't have that we have just about every medice xxunk available to us hygiene wise but eventually as we get further further away that may be more of an issue as well of contag some of the xxunk bacteria if you 're very far away from xxmaj earth you 're gog to have to solve that problem on your own so i thk dealg germs cleanless xxunk are gon na be a bigger issue as we go forward where you 're gon na need to take all your toothpaste you or figure out a way to make it or somethg so we 've got to thk about these issues as you move forward [ ] you,xxbos xxmaj transcriber : xxmaj xxunk xxmaj tan \n",
